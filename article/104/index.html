My dose was way too low, but they don’t want to start you out too high and there’s no way to predict because everyone&amp;#39;s different,” Nettenstrom said. “Everything was just slow, like my hands weren’t doing what my brain wanted them to, I was sleeping 16 hours a day, and waiting to have the dose adjusted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A graduate student in UW’s &lt;a href=\&quot;https://cancerbiology.wisc.edu/\&quot;&gt;Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt; program at the time, Nettenstrom left the program and earned a Masters degree, not the doctorate for which she planned.
