He never could have dreamed he eventually would receive the gift of life more than 1,000 miles away in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nJoe learned he suffered from liver disease in summer 2019. While doctors tried various medications to treat his condition, it soon became clear that a transplant was his only option.

Even if he had been able to get on the wait list for a liver transplant, he knew he likely would wait a long time at his hospital in New England.\r\n\r\nBut serendipity turned his situation around. His wife, Janet, was talking to a friend whose brother needed a transplant several years ago. The brother grew up with &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080&lt;/span&gt;, MD, a transplant surgeon at the UW Health Liver Transplant Program. The friend connected Joe and Janet with her brother, who in turn put them in touch with Dr. Foley.

Dr. Foley suggested that Joe travel to Wisconsin to be assessed for transplant there. “This is where our love affair with UW Health began,” says Joe. \r\n\r\nThe Murrays came to Madison right after Memorial Day and were able to get on the wait list.

Katie began her sophomore year of high school attending classes remotely from Wisconsin, and Joe and Janet established friendships with other residents of their apartment building, including a UW Health nurse. “Neither of us had ever lived in the Midwest,” says Joe. “We both loved it there. When it was time for us to leave in October, it was very hard for us because such an amazing thing had happened in Wisconsin.”\r\n\r\nThe Murray family returned home on October 16 and were greeted by a socially distanced group of friends and neighbors in their driveway. Since then, Joe has continued with his medical care closer to home, but he still keeps in close contact with many of the caregivers with whom he connected while in Madison. “I felt like the luckiest person on the planet even before I received the transplant,” he says. “My care at UW Health was outstanding.
