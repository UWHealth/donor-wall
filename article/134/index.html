He began radiation and chemotherapy, and while treatments eliminated most evidence of the disease, he said side effects were nearly unbearable. A year later, the cancer was back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then Dr. Walter Vogel, his oncologist at the Beloit Cancer Center, mentioned a possible new treatment option. Based on the results of an NSCLC clinical trial, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just months prior fast-tracked the approval of a targeted drug therapy, Crizotinib, for patients whose tumors had a mutation in the ALK gene. Melby’s tumor was sequenced and found to be one of the roughly 4 percent of NSCLCs that are ALK+. He began taking Crizotonib almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just don’t see oncologists be giddy, but after Glen’s first PET scan after he started the drug, Dr. Vogel was,” said Dianne Melby, Glen’s wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly two years, Melby took Crizotonib, an oral drug that targets ALK-mutated cancer cells and therefore has fewer side effects than standard chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his cancer grew resistant to Crizotonib, and Vogel referred Melby to Dr. &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: P7750&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: 15041&lt;/span&gt;. Traynor offered him an option to enroll in a clinical trial to investigate a next-generation ALK-targeted therapy, Alectinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After having such success with Crizotinib, stepping into this trial was a no-brainer for me,” Melby said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began the trial in February 2014. While his cancer is still detectable by scans, there has been no further advancement of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This drug has been wonderful for me,” Melby said. “The fact that side effects are minimal, the fact that I go on with my life, I go to Florida to see my grandkids. It’s been over seven years since I was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, and I’m still here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traynor noted future patients would benefit from Melby’s participation in the Alectinib trial, just as he had benefitted from those who had enrolled in the Crozotinib trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without brave patients like Glen enrolling in trials, cancer science cannot move forward,” Traynor said.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;]}" ssr="" client="load" before-hydration-url="data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8,//[no before-hydration script]" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ArticleView&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children="">
