&quot;It was a nightmare,&quot; said Kerin Colson, Kaden&#39;s mother. &quot;We came up with a system where he would knock on the wall to alert us that a seizure was coming.&quot;</p><p>He was on 7 seizure medications.

&quot;Kaden has a better outlook on life, and while it&#39;s not perfect, we&#39;ll continue to work toward his goals.&quot;</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></section></div></div>
