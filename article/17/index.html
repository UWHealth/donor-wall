So, when the Fond du Lac woman learned in 2018 that she, too, had developed breast cancer, &amp;quot;My nine-year-old was very upset, and said, &amp;#39;Are you going to go bald, too?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the answer to that question was no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was time for her chemo treatments to begin, her nurse at the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.uwhealth.org/breast-center/45303\&quot;&gt;UW Health Breast Center&lt;/a&gt; suggested using &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/breast-cancer/scalp-cooling-caps/51262\&quot;&gt;cooling caps&lt;/a&gt;. Both of UW Carbone&amp;#39;s Madison chemotherapy clinics offer a cooling cap system for use during chemotherapy. The caps contain circulating refrigerant, which chills the scalp, closing the blood vessels and preventing the drugs from getting into the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It has been such a blessing to me,&amp;quot; Schmidt says. &amp;quot;It was so hard for my sisters to lose their hair. And growing it back out is no fun, either.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schmidt paid $2,200 for caps to wear during her 12 rounds of chemotherapy (the cooling caps vendor, Paxman, works with a non-profit called Hair-to-Stay that provides financial assistance for low income patients). She says the cold is &amp;quot;very tolerable&amp;quot; and she coped by cuddling in a warm blanket. She used the caps for a half hour before and an hour after the infusion, to reduce the damage to the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d recommend it to everyone. I lost my eyebrows, my eyelashes and all the hair on my body,&amp;quot; she says. But her long blonde hair stayed right where it was. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m beyond grateful; you wear your hair everywhere.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits were many. Keeping her hair meant keeping her privacy. The family owns a manufacturing business, and she and her husband, Rick, frequently entertain international customers. Looking healthy meant not having to discuss her treatment with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She even had an amusing moment when she was at the clinic for chemo. A friend who was bald from her own chemotherapy was with her and the nurses were startled that Schmidt, and not her friend, was the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking normal made her children less frightened than they may have been (and sometimes she had to remind them, &amp;quot;Hey, mom&lt;i&gt; is&lt;/i&gt; sick, can you pitch in a little?&amp;quot;). The family was also dealing with another serious health issue during her treatment: her grandson was born with a major heart defect that eventually required a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You go through so many emotions with cancer, so much anger and feeling so sick,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; she says, adding that she knows that for other women, hair is the least of their concerns as they go through treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Schmidt, keeping her hair gave her a boost and helped her feel more normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and see that I still had my hair,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d feel like: &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve got this.
