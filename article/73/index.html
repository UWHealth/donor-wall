But the woman from Charlotte, Tenn., woman found the &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: 1LpsqlWQAyXXcxnKNAxcbM&lt;/span&gt; at UW Health, where doctors performed a procedure that finally gave her relief from her pain.\r\n\r\nEven as a child, Heather suffered from extraordinary pain during her menstrual cycles — pain that caused her to stay home from school several days each month. During her first pregnancy at age 22, she experienced debilitating Braxton-Hicks contractions, a problem which continued and worsened during her second pregnancy. By the time she stopped breastfeeding her third child, her body settled into a pattern of hormone levels that made the pain constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of my doctors could figure out what was wrong,” said Heather, who is now 38. “My gynecologist thought I just had really bad PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome).”\r\n\r\nIn 2016, doctors diagnosed her with pelvic congestion, and she underwent a hysterectomy.

She called UW Health and spoke with Shanee Ellison, transplant coordinator for the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She knew exactly what I was talking about,” said Heather. “For so many years, I thought I was just a weak person who wasn’t capable of dealing with pain.
