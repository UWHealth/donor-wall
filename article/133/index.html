The very first Eric Wolfe Fellow, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.humonc.wisc.edu/team_member/hima-bindu-musunuru-mbbs-mrcp-uk-frcr-uk/\&quot;&gt;Dr. Hima “Bindu” Musunuru&lt;/a&gt;, is currently in the second year of her radiation oncology research fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Musunuru’s research has focused on using radiation in a more targeted manner, to avoid harming healthy tissue surrounding the tumor, an issue that is especially important to brain-cancer patients. While she has been involved with projects involving several cancer types, her work with UW Carbone brain-cancer specialist &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/steven-p-howard-md-phd/6356\&quot;&gt;Dr. Steven Howard&lt;/a&gt; is aimed at delivering radiation in pulsed low doses to treat brain cancer that has returned after initial treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have truly enjoyed this fellowship, which has given me an opportunity to develop unique clinical protocols involving targeted radiation therapy while minimizing side effects,’’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Jerry Wolfe, he remembers Dr. Howard as being part of the team that cared for Eric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They took care of him for five years, and that’s why I’m so committed to the UW Carbone Cancer Center,’’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfe says that the 20th Golf for Wolfes will be his largest fundraiser, although he expects the event will continue in a less formal manner in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harari laughs and acknowledges that Jerry Wolfe certainly deserves to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jerry has been telling me for years he is going to slow down,’’ Harari says. “However, I have seen no sign of it. He is like the energizer bunny.
