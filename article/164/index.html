An episode of E. coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) resulted in kidney failure and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lindsay is a miracle,&amp;quot; said her mom, Rhonda. &amp;quot;We were told she would never walk or talk again, but her recovery has been remarkable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay got sick in July 1990, and she spent July through September in the hospital. When she came home, she had a feeding tube because she was unable to eat by mouth, and could not walk or talk. She also experienced temporary blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But when she got home, things started coming together,&amp;quot; Rhonda said. &amp;quot;By Thanksgiving, she was learning to walk again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she understands a great deal, she speaks only in one- or two-word sentences and uses some sign language to communicate. But Lindsay has never let the obstacles she faces deter her optimism and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She is the happiest person in the world,&amp;quot; Rhonda said. &amp;quot;Wherever she goes, whoever she meets, people just fall in love with her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kidney transplant needed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lindsay grew, her kidney function worsened. She became very thin, tired and nauseated. She had her kidney transplant, with her mother serving as her donor, at age 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The transplant went so well,&amp;quot; Rhonda said. &amp;quot;She felt so much better after her transplant. She&amp;#39;s now doing so many things we never thought she&amp;#39;d be able to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhonda acknowledges not only the excellent medical care she and Lindsay received, but the overall care and concern as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The medical team, including Dr. Hans Sollinger and pediatric transplant coordinator Beth Gerndt-Spaith, were so thorough. Nothing got by them,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since graduation, Lindsay has attended an in-home day care center, though she sees it more as her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She loves going there,&amp;quot; Rhonda said. &amp;quot;She helps out like an assistant would, and has even taught some of the children sign language.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many young women, Lindsay enjoys shopping, especially for shoes. She loves country music, boating, fishing and swimming. She&amp;#39;s earned medals and ribbons as a gymnast in the Special Olympics, and has made many friends through her gymnastics program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Miss RemarkAble Pageant&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rhonda heard about the Miss RemarkAble Pageant happening in their hometown of Onalaska, Wis., she knew Lindsay would love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay applied and was accepted as one of nine contestants who would experience a one-of-a-kind opportunity to build life skills, confidence and share her abilities and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay practiced her introduction and prepared for the question-and-answer session, as well as walking across the stage and waving. She loved the wardrobe changes, getting her hair and make-up done and meeting Miss Wisconsin and Miss Onalaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay was crowned &amp;quot;Miss Incredible,&amp;quot; in recognition of everything she has endured, and she proudly accepted her crown, sash and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Lindsay&amp;#39;s journey hasn&amp;#39;t been easy, her family never lost hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When she was little and so sick, we really just took one day at a time,&amp;quot; Rhonda said. &amp;quot;We never looked too far into the future, but did everything we could to support her and to keep a positive attitude.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Lindsay and her family are happily looking into the future as they plan a baby shower for Lindsay&amp;#39;s brother and wife.
