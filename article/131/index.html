Two rounds of abdominal surgery left her with an incision she proudly describes as &amp;quot;a map of Route 66.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beloit woman also wants to use her hard-won wisdom to inspire others faced with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to help other people and let them know to get a second opinion,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I would be dead right now if I hadn&amp;#39;t followed my instinct.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: P7871&lt;/span&gt;, her surgeon at the &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: L228&lt;/span&gt;, says that McCormick&amp;#39;s story inspires hope.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Claudia&amp;#39;s story is one that all of us want to be able to tell more — she is an amazing woman with resilience and fortitude, who agreed to all of our recommended aggressive treatments for pancreas cancer, and because of this, she has beaten the odds,&amp;quot; says Weber. &amp;quot;She has an incredible multidisciplinary team of doctors helping her through this, but the victory is all hers.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both McCormick and Weber want to increase the odds of surviving pancreatic cancer, so they are supporting the Aug. 12 &amp;quot;Roll and Stroll,” to support pancreatic-cancer research at UW Carbone Cancer Center. The event includes 50- and 10-kilometer bike rides, a two-mile walk, as well as music and family fun at Capital Brewery in Middleton.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormick&amp;#39;s journey began in the fall of 2016, when she noticed some vague early symptoms. She felt tired; her skin was itchy and slightly yellow. Her doctor wasn&amp;#39;t sure what was wrong; that&amp;#39;s when McCormick&amp;#39;s survival instinct kicked in the first time.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I asked her to check my liver enzymes and I didn&amp;#39;t even know what liver enzymes were, she says. They came back high. A follow-up ultrasound and biopsy revealed a tumor about one and a half inches big in the head of her pancreas. The diagnosis was stage 1B adenoma carcinoma.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three months of FOLFIRINOX, a combination of five chemotherapy drugs, in March 2017, a surgeon at a community hospital attempted to do a Whipple procedure to remove the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, bile duct, and parts of the stomach and small intestine.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the surgeon opened her up, he decided he couldn&amp;#39;t safely operate.\r\nWhile McCormick was still unconscious, the surgeon gathered her family. McCormick heard the verdict herself, later.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said there was nothing he or anyone could do and that I had months to live,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;He basically wrote me off.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormick, a mother of two grown sons and a grandmother of one, began putting her affairs in order. She got very depressed. But then she got mad.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s not God, and not going to tell me when it&amp;#39;s time to go,&amp;quot; she says.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family and friends rallied around her. Her partner, Al, who had lost a wife to colon cancer, became her &amp;quot;best angel,&amp;quot; cooking and caring for her. Her sisters and brother-in-law chipped in with support from afar, and lots of Internet research on her disease.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wanted to show them that their support was really meaningful,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Knowing how much they were doing for me, I couldn&amp;#39;t just give up and die.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She asked her medical oncologist to look into clinical trials, and she began another round of oral chemotherapy along with external beam radiation.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her younger sister found supplements that she believes helped her body heal, including high dose CBD oil, Frankincense oil, turkey tail mushroom and a Chinese remedy called &amp;quot;bitter melon,” among others.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in late August 2017, she came to the UW Carbone Cancer Center, where Weber met with her to discuss her case. McCormick was impressed.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She has this aura about her that is really serene, and these beautiful long fingers,&amp;quot; McCormick recalled. Weber was willing to attempt another Whipple procedure, although she told McCormick her odds of being able to complete the operation were only about 50-50.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when McCormick woke up after surgery in November 2017, her first question was: &amp;quot;Did it happen?”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I heard yes, I started crying,&amp;quot; McCormick remembers.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biopsy showed that the tumor had shrunk and had been completely removed. Since then, two scans have shown her clear of cancer. Her CA 19-9 number, which measures antigens in the blood released by tumor cells, fell from 535 at diagnosis to 35 after treatment to 13, well in the normal range, at her last check-up.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now I have a second chance at life, and I want to get out there and help other people,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;I tell them: You have to fight. You also need a support system. I couldn&amp;#39;t do it alone and no one else can, either.”\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends the information and support available at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.pancan.org/\&quot;&gt;PanCAN&lt;/a&gt;). Her brother-in-law found the site, and through it, she found Weber.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCormick is getting involved in advocacy for more funding for pancreas cancer research and volunteers with UW&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/pancreatic-cancer/pancreas-cancer-task-force/38121\&quot;&gt;Pancreas Cancer Task Force&lt;/a&gt; – made up of patients, community leaders, family members, and caretakers dedicated to funding pancreas cancer research at UW&amp;#39;s Carbone Cancer Center.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, during her corporate career, she was inspired by motivational speaker Tony Robbins, and wanted to use that passion to help others.\r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Since I have a second chance at life, I now have that chance to help others overcome the odds and beat this disease,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;If I&amp;#39;m not helping someone every day, then I&amp;#39;m not doing enough.
