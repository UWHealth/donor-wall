After years of testing at another hospital she was diagnosed with pulmonary veno occlusive disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. She learned she needed a lung transplant to survive. After just nine days on the active waiting list at UW Health, she received her gift of life. Within days she was making laps around the hospital. A few months later she is walking 25 miles a week. “I keep setting goals for myself,” says Jennifer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\rThrough it all, Jennifer focused on her future.

She donated her diseased lungs for research and participated in a research study to help lung transplant patients with swallow issues. She quickly wrote to thank her donor family and was thrilled to get a letter back. That letter described her donor, stating, “We had a hard time keeping up with her.” Hearing that, Jennifer’s friends said those lungs were a perfect match for Jennifer.
