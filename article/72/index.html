Sarah, 43, knows now that she has had vascular compression issues her whole life. But she first started experiencing debilitating symptoms in 2019. She felt sick to her stomach and was vomiting all the time, and she had chronic pain in her back and stomach area. An emergency room doctor diagnosed her with superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMA), a condition that occurs when two arteries pinch the small intestine. But other doctors rejected the diagnosis and accused her of making up her symptoms.

Near the end of 2019, Sarah learned about nutcracker syndrome, which occurs when two arteries pinch the left renal vein, causing blood to flow backward. Through her online research, she became convinced she suffered from nutcracker syndrome, too (it turned out she also had several other compression syndromes, as well). That was what was causing her extreme pain. A doctor confirmed her self-diagnosis, but the question remained: How could she solve her problem? “I was in so much pain, I couldn’t function at all,” she said. “It was horrible.”

During the surgery, the doctor removes the patient’s kidney and ureter and places them in a different spot in the body, thus relieving the compression.
