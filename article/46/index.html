Sophie, 14, first began experiencing health problems in December 2020. Within a matter of weeks, she lost weight, suffered through leg pain and numbness and learned she had a cyst on her spinal cord. Physical and occupational therapy relieved some of that pain, but later she developed significant left-sided abdominal and flank pain. When her doctor ordered a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the radiologist found a serious problem: she had nutcracker syndrome.

Nutcracker syndrome is a rare vein compression disorder in which an artery in the abdomen squeezes the left renal vein and impairs the blood flow draining the kidney. This can cause many chronic problems, the worst being chronic left-side abdominal and flank pain. Sophie had experienced abdominal pain throughout her childhood, but her parents never dreamed that she had such a serious condition.

The Beyers live in Prescott, Wisconsin, which is right across the border from Minnesota and near the Twin Cities.
