He developed an infection in his abdomen, and his transplant coordinator told his wife, Tammy, to bring him to the Reedsburg emergency room right away. Over the next eight hours, his health rapidly deteriorated. Doctors in Reedsburg determined he needed to be admitted to University Hospital right away and transported him there via ambulance. “He was so sick,” says Tammy. “I was concerned he was not going to make it. I was just relieved that other people were caring for him, and that he was in the right place to receive treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that point, he was sick enough to rise to the top of the transplant list—but he couldn’t be transplanted until his infection was successfully treated.

I will get your father a liver for your anniversary,’” says Dean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their anniversary was two days later—and sure enough, Dean received a call that day with another liver. He received his gift of life on Aug. 29, 2018—the day after his anniversary. The transplant was performed by Dr. &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: P6906&lt;/span&gt; and the UW Health team. Seven days later, he developed complications, and he required a procedure to fix his bile duct. After the procedure and a second surgery, his health dramatically improved, and three months after the transplant, he returned to his job as a construction field superintendent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m doing extremely well,” he says, “I feel like a new person and have energy I haven’t felt for years.
