Too many patients were ahead of him on the transplant list - and most of them were even sicker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brian makes an important call&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard&amp;#39;s brother, Garry, told Brian about a friend of his who got screened to become a living liver donor. (A living donor undergoes surgery in which part, not all, of the liver is removed. Within weeks, the liver grows back in size.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Talking with Garry made me think about becoming a living liver donor for Richard,&amp;quot; said Brian. &amp;quot;At first, I assumed it was unlikely that my liver would be a match for Richard. Still, I was curious enough to look into it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that Richard was being cared for by the UW Health Transplant Team in Madison, Brian spoke with Transplant Coordinator Beth Spaith the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I knew my blood type matched Richard&amp;#39;s, so Beth explained everything I would have to go through just to determine if I could be a donor,&amp;quot; Brian said. &amp;quot;It was a little daunting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn if he would qualify as Richard&amp;#39;s liver donor, Brian would have to undergo three days of extensive screening in Madison. The outcome was out of his hands, but Brian found some comfort in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My wife, Elaine, and I kept saying that God was driving the car and we were just riding in the back seat waiting to see where it would go,&amp;quot; Brian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also available to Brian — and to anyone considering becoming a living donor — are UW Health social workers, who go over every facet of the process and stay engaged with living donors throughout their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;While there is no medical benefit to becoming a living donor — and there clearly are risks — the emotional payoff of supporting a loved one or friend this way can be incredibly high,&amp;quot; said UW Health Transplant social worker Paul Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Total support from family&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian made a point of involving his entire family as he weighed the pluses and minuses of donating part of his liver. If he was a match, Brian would undergo a complex surgery followed by six to 12 weeks of recuperation that would greatly impact Elaine, their five children, and the employees of his family-run dairy farm. He would not move forward without everyone&amp;#39;s buy-in, which he received in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A lot of people would have to pick up the slack for me. It took a village, and we were very lucky to have a village,&amp;quot; Brian said. Following the screening process, Brian passed every test and the transplant surgery was scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With three surgeons required, along with two comprehensive medical staffs — one for the donor and one for the recipient — scheduling a transplant surgery can take up to a few months to coordinate. Fortunately, everything fell into place for a July 1, 2019, surgery, a mere six weeks after Brian first thought about becoming a living donor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Would &amp;#39;do it again in a heartbeat&amp;#39;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything went well and today, Brian is fully recovered. Richard is back home in Rockford, Ill., with a new lease on life, thanks to his generous cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I would do it again in a heartbeat,&amp;quot; Brian said. &amp;quot;For someone considering it, this is not something to take lightly. The first week after surgery was kind of tough, but by Week 5, I was just about back to normal. It&amp;#39;s also amazing how quickly both my liver and Richard&amp;#39;s grew back in just a few weeks. Most of all, this whole experience brought our family even closer. It&amp;#39;s hard to put a price on that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;]}" ssr="" client="load" before-hydration-url="data:text/javascript;charset=utf-8,//[no before-hydration script]" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ArticleView&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children="">
