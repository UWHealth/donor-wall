As a child, he had one kidney removed due to complications from a birth defect, and when his remaining kidney started developing problems, the only solutions were either dialysis or a transplant. He resisted going on dialysis for a long time because he was in denial about his condition — until his nephrologist finally told Heidi to take him to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I spent several months fearing my husband was going to die at any moment,&amp;quot; Heidi said. &amp;quot;Doctors told me he could have had a stroke because he waited so long to go on dialysis.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Scott&amp;#39;s adult daughter and his sister were willing to donate their kidneys to him, but when they learned they couldn&amp;#39;t donate because of health issues, Heidi stepped up — despite Scott&amp;#39;s protests. While Heidi wasn&amp;#39;t a direct match for her husband, they were able to participate in a paired kidney exchange in which Heidi donated her kidney to a stranger, and that stranger&amp;#39;s loved one gave a kidney to Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week before the surgery at University Hospital in Madison, Scott&amp;#39;s surgeon, &lt;span&gt;type: entry-hyperlink id: P8868&lt;/span&gt;, MD, asked if he would be willing to participate in a drug trial following his transplant. Belatacept, an anti-rejection medication, had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but UW Health was involved in a trial that would allow patients to substitute belatacept for calcineurin inhibitors and the need for chronic use of steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott agreed, and when his participation in the study ended two years later, he chose to continue belatacept, which requires him to undergo an infusion of medication once a month instead of taking steroids and enduring their side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t even think twice about it because it&amp;#39;s worked so well,&amp;quot; Scott said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had no side effects from the medication at all, except for canker sores.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the belatacept, Scott is able to live his life without limitations.
