      "story": "<p>A highly accomplished product manager for a scientific instrument company, Mike Bradley of Fitchburg, Wis. remembers the day he went  back to work in January 2019, just after the winter holidays. To say the day did not go as planned would be a huge understatement.</p><p>First, Mike’s right eye went dark. Next, he could not move several muscles normally. Finally, he collapsed to the floor. Mike didn’t know it at the time, but he was having a serious stroke at the age of 59. </p><p>After first responders arrived, nobody knew for sure if they would ever see Mike at work or perhaps ever again. If there was a promising sign, however, he still displayed his wicked sense of humor as he was being carted off to an ambulance.</p><p>“I waved to everyone and said it was just a performance review that went badly,” he says, nearly 3 ½ years later.</p><p>The blood clot that caused Mike’s stroke originated in his right carotid artery, one of two vessels on either side of the neck that carry blood to the brain, neck and face. Because the layers of the artery wall were tearing, a blockage formed that reduced the amount of blood flowing to the brain.</p><p>In circumstances like Mike’s, the body often compensates by making use of other blood vessels to send blood to the brain. He was recovering at UW Health’s Rehabilitation Hospital on Madison’s East Side when he suffered a second stroke just 12 days after the first one.</p><p>This time, he lost all sensation on his left side. After being rushed to University Hospital, imaging showed that the clot intensified, preventing any blood from reaching the right side of his brain. Immediate action was needed, and if you’re in Mike’s predicament, the best news you can hear is that UW Health neurosurgeon Mustafa K. Baskaya, MD, is on the way to operate.</p><p>As Mike put it, “The world comes to Baskaya,” which is not much of an exaggeration. He operates on the brains and spines of many patients from near and far, many of whom have been told there is nothing more that can be done for them. </p><h2>Rare emergency brain surgery needed</h2><p>Mike was quickly taken to the operating room where Dr. Baskaya performed what is called an extracranial-to-intercranial (EC-IC) bypass. Not unlike a heart bypass, the EC-IC bypass creates a new passageway for blood to reach the brain through borrowing a small piece of artery from a different place in the body.</p><p>In Mike’s case, Dr. Baskaya took a section of Mike’s superficial temporal artery from Mike’s forehead to create the bypass.  </p><p>“EC-IC bypass is not a common surgery,” says Dr. Baskaya. “I do about 10 to 20 a year. Anyone who needs this procedure should have it performed at a center like ours where our team has extensive experience. This involves maneuvering blood vessels too small to be seen with the naked eye, so special operating rooms and equipment are needed to ensure the best outcome.”</p><p>After 10 days in the hospital, Mike returned to UW Health’s Rehab Hospital, where he would spend four more weeks re-acquiring the physical and cognitive skills that were impacted by the stroke.</p><p>“It’s a long process to begin reconnecting with the life you were used to,” Mike says. “Fortunately, I had three outstanding therapists at the Rehab Hospital help me with things like walking, cooking, dressing myself, making my bed and so many other things most of us take for granted. I’m also not much of a physical specimen so it was important both personally and professionally that my grey matter would function well enough for me to return to work.”</p><h2>Emotional swings affect Mike </h2><p>Some stroke patients find themselves more vulnerable to emotional swings, and Mike was no exception.</p><p>“Most of us have an internal check that helps control our emotions,” he says. “Mine disappeared after the stroke, so now I cry easily at the smallest provocation. It makes me self-conscious at times, but my therapists were incredibly supportive when the tears would start flowing.”</p><p>According to UW Health occupational therapist Carrin Lichty, many stroke patients deal with emotional swings, increased anxiety or depression. </p><p>“Some patients who never cried before their stroke suddenly start to cry at the tiniest things, be they sad or happy. Therapists often support the emotional changes that a patient experiences after a stroke. Sometimes just listening to patients, validating what they are experiencing, and providing reassurance can make a big difference in their therapy.”</p><p>Sara Garvin, Mike’s physical therapist, says it often helps to break recovery goals into smaller, digestible pieces. </p><p>“We might say, ‘Let’s start by getting you home’ as the first goal,” Sara says. “Once you get home, you can start focusing on next steps such as driving, getting back to work, or resuming hobbies.”</p><h2>Support group reduces isolation </h2><p>Many people find that talking with and listening to other stroke patients helps make them feel less isolated. Mike was among those who took advantage of a monthly <a href=\"https://patient.uwhealth.org/education/virtual-madison-area-stroke-and-aneurysm-support-group\">UW Health/UnityPoint Health – Meriter Stroke and Aneurysm Support Group</a> that is open to patients and their family members. </p><p>In-person meetings were the norm for years, but the group switched to online gatherings about two years ago with the onset of COVID-19. Fortunately, the virtual meetings allow for easier access, saving patients or family members the worry of driving to University Hospital.</p><p>“Mike attended our meetings regularly for quite a while,” says Melanie McCauley, RN, who coordinates the support group. “He is a wonderful, charismatic person who has come a long way and helps others by talking very openly and philosophically about how his life has been impacted by a stroke.”</p><p>As for advice to others, Mike points out that every minute is precious at the onset of a stroke. “Even if you are not sure if someone is having a stroke, don’t think twice about calling 911 because brain cells may be dying every minute.”</p><p>Married for 36 years to his wife Kathryn with two grown children, Mike can’t overstate how grateful he is to the UW Health Stroke Team not only for saving his life but helping him reach so many of his goals physically and emotionally. </p><p>“My biggest hurdle can be my own impatience,” Mike says. “It was very frustrating at first trying and failing at simple tasks like filling out a grocery form. Madison, my speech therapist, kept telling me to slow down, but slowing things down goes against my natural instinct.”</p><p>While no one would choose to go through what Mike did, he can’t say enough about the care he received from his doctors, nurses and therapists.</p><p>“The day I checked out, I wept and wept knowing they would not be there anymore,” says Mike, now 63. “All things considered, I know how lucky I am to be around to share my story and continue finding joy in life.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Pregnant with her third child, Staci Devries went in for what she expected to be a routine 20-week ultrasound. When she was told that her new baby would be born with a serious heart complication, it was all she could do keep her emotions in check.</p><p>“My husband was not with me that day, but my two kids, ages 1 and 3, were, so I had to keep it together in front of them,” Staci said. “With two healthy children, you just don’t expect the next one won’t be healthy.”</p><p>Their new baby — later named Joelle — was born in September 2019 with an underdeveloped left side of her heart. If surgery was not performed within the next few days, Joelle would not survive because her heart wasn’t big enough to pump enough blood out to the rest of her body.</p><p>After birth and stabilization in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Joelle underwent the complicated Norwood surgery on Day 7 of life, which was performed by Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8971</span>, a pediatric heart surgeon who is also surgeon-in-chief at American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison. Additional surgeries and procedures would be needed to encourage growth of her undersized left ventricle (lower chamber) over the coming months and years.</p><p>“Normal hearts operate with two pumping ventricles, but Joelle was born with only a single ventricle to do the work of two,” said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10310</span>, Joelle’s UW Health Kids cardiologist. “The high complexity of this condition means these kids typically undergo three surgeries to reconstruct the way the heart pumps blood to the lungs and the body.&quot;</p><p>Historically, children like Joelle would never achieve normal circulation. They would undergo three surgeries yet still depend on a single ventricle to pump blood. Fortunately, UW Health Kids takes a more aggressive approach whenever possible.</p><h3>Two working ventricles is ideal</h3><p>“Whenever possible, our goal is to rehabilitate the smaller ventricle, so it grows as close as possible to normal size,” said Dr. Anagnostopoulos. “The process still requires three surgeries, but the long-term prognosis is better for a normal life because the heart won’t get as tired with two working ventricles instead of just one.”</p><p>Only a handful of centers around the country have the capability to successfully complete this approach, known as biventricular conversion. Children undergoing this three-surgery sequence require highly attentive family monitoring at home.\r</p><h3>Interstage program helps families like Joelle’s\r</h3><p>“We have what we call an interstage program to help families like Joelle’s keep a close watch on the child’s weight, oxygen saturation and feedings in between the first and second operations,” said Dr. Hoyme. “It’s really important that families report anything unusual right away so we can evaluate early and intervene if necessary.”</p><p>At 7 months old, Joelle was ready for the second in the series of surgeries to gradually increase the use of the left heart, with the goal to have her heart work with two pumping ventricles. She recovered well from the operation, but unexpectedly remained in the hospital because of an unrelated persistent leakage of fatty fluid that developed between her lungs and chest wall. Very few children’s hospitals intervene when this condition — known as chylothorax — persists, so plans were made for Joelle to go to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for a procedure.</p><p>“The day after the doctors and our family talked about going to Philadelphia, her fluid leakage began to slow and thankfully, it eventually stopped,&quot; Staci said. &quot;We can only conclude that Joelle wanted to stay in Madison. We were so grateful, because traveling to Philadelphia would have been a huge ordeal.”</p><p>Joelle’s heart condition was the Devries’ primary focus, but after Joelle’s dad, Bram, received a job offer in Oklahoma, things became more complicated. </p><h3>Family insisted on UW Health, despite move to Oklahoma\r</h3><p>“Even though the town we’d be moving to was 16 hours away, we still wanted Joelle to go to Madison for any future surgeries or invasive procedures,&quot; Staci said. &quot;We love the UW and wouldn’t bring her anywhere else for advanced care. If our insurance in Oklahoma wouldn’t cover her care in Wisconsin, we weren’t going to move.”</p><p>Staci spent two weeks on the phone ironing things out with the insurance company. Ultimately, the coverage was approved, and the Devries family moved to Hendrix, Okla. — population 79 — in February 2021. While the UW Health Kids heart team still manages Joelle&#39;s care remotely, her day-to-day needs are met by Children’s Health Medical Center in Plano, Texas, about a 75-minute drive from their new home.</p><p>When she turned 2 in September 2021, Joelle started eating by mouth instead of relying on a feeding tube. By April 2022, testing showed that the rehabilitation of her left ventricle succeeded. It was now large enough to take over pumping blood to the body by itself. Surgery was set for June 2, meaning another 16-hour drive from Oklahoma to Madison for the family of six.</p><p>“They took her at 7:45 a.m. for surgery and we finally got to see her at 9:35 that evening,” said Staci. “It was a long day, but so incredible to see her come back with normal color and 100 percent oxygen saturation for the first time in her life.”\r</p><p>During the surgery, Dr. Anagnostopoulos restored all of Joelle’s anatomic connections, allowing her heart to function normally.\r</p><p>“Our team will keep a close eye on Joelle as she grows to make sure the left heart works without a hitch,” he said. “She is recovering beautifully and will hopefully never require any more interventions or surgeries.”</p><p>With her third big surgery behind her, Joelle will soon return to Oklahoma to resume chasing her siblings Brigham, Edynn and Kameron and enjoying life on the farm.</p><p>“You’d never know she has been through all of this when you watch her play,” said Staci. “She has one heck of a personality.”\r</p><p>Despite the physical distance between Oklahoma and Wisconsin, Joelle will always be part of the “family” at American Family Children’s Hospital.</p><p>“Nobody else can beat the doctors in Madison,” Staci said. “There’s not enough I can say about this team. Their standards are very high and driving 16 hours is worth it to ensure that Joelle gets the best care.”</p><div></div><p>\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Carol Albright is the very picture of good health—physically, mentally and socially. She exercises regularly, her blood pressure and cholesterol numbers are healthy, she doesn’t drink alcohol, and she’s been very involved in her community as a school board member for eight years. She enjoys travel, a good mystery novel, playing with her dog Nutmeg and her garden. \r</p><p>An outsider might envy Carol’s good fortune—except her health has nothing to do with luck. It’s a combination of receiving the gift of life and working hard to be able to receive that gift.</p><p>Throughout her life, Carol was overweight and drank alcohol. In 2016, she began experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms including violent vomiting and constipation. Doctors performed a liver biopsy and learned she had a combination of alcoholic cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and fatty liver. </p><p>Early in 2017, Carol underwent a trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, during which doctors created a pathway through her liver by connecting the veins going into and out of her liver. Despite the TIPS procedure, she continued to need to return the hospital for multiple paracentesis procedures in which doctors removed excess fluid from her abdomen.</p><p>During her last paracentesis procedure, Carol developed an infection that landed her in the hospital. She was at SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Madison, and doctors there felt she needed a liver transplant soon, so they contacted the UW Health Transplant Center, also in Madison. UW Health doctors told them to transfer Carol to their hospital, and she completed a liver transplant evaluation soon after she arrived. After her evaluation was complete, the liver transplant team determined she was a candidate to be placed on the liver transplant wait list.</p><p>Within hours, Carol learned a liver had become available. “Afterward, when I was in recovery, I met people who had waited for a liver for years, and I felt guilty that my wait was so short,” she says. “I must have been sick enough to rise to the top of the wait list.”</p><p>Carol received her gift of life on Sept. 8, 2017. As she was recovering in the hospital, however, she went into cardiac arrest and doctors put her into a medically induced coma for a week. It turned out she had takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or “broken heart syndrome,” a condition in which the heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened. “It was caused by the overwhelming stress from everything that was going on,” she says.</p><p>After about a month Carol returned home under the care of family and friends, who took turns “babysitting” her as she healed. The process was slow, however—she struggled with gastrointestinal symptoms, arthritis pain and weight gain, and she was in and out of the hospital for four months.</p><p>While Carol had always been active since she retired from teaching high school Spanish at age 60, she started working with a personal trainer at the end of 2018. That encouraged her to push herself—she was focused on retaining her hard-fought good health. Her most recent trainer challenged her to lose five pounds a month. She met that challenge. “I got inspired because I was finally losing weight,” she says.</p><p>Now, Carol is in good shape, she doesn’t touch alcohol and her blood pressure and cholesterol are normal. “I will never dishonor my donor by messing up and not taking care of myself,” she says. </p>",

      "story": "<p>For the longest time, Taya Larson was scared to use the “R” word: Remission.</p><p>She’s been through a lot over the past two years. After a surprise diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in early 2017, the 40-year-old teacher from Oregon, Wis., received several chemotherapy treatments and a course of radiation.</p><p>A scan appeared to show a remission after the radiation, but the tumor came back, bigger than ever. “It was almost twice as big as when I first was diagnosed,” Larson said.</p><p>But now, one year after receiving an innovative immunotherapy called <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15220</span> at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15041</span>, Larson is no longer shying away from the word.</p><p>“I’m finally telling people I’m in remission,” she said. “My husband and I were afraid to be happy about a clear scan. But finally, I think we’re good.”</p><p>It’s also an exciting development for Larson’s oncologist, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8636</span>, MD. “We are very hopeful that this continued remission at one year is an indication of a cure,” Kenkre said.</p><p>Up until a few years ago, a cure wouldn’t have even been in the conversation for a lymphoma patient like Larson.</p><p>“Quite honestly, I think probably less than 10 percent of patients would be alive at a year who were in her position – not responding to standard chemotherapy,” Kenkre said. However, CAR T-cell therapy now gives oncologists like Kenkre a new and potential hopeful option to treat adults with aggressive lymphomas, even if chemotherapy has failed.</p><p>Approved by the FDA in 2017, CAR T-cell therapy uses the body’s own immune system as a weapon against cancer, effectively “super-charging” a patient’s own white blood cells. Those white blood cells, or T cells, are withdrawn from a patient and sent to a lab, where the cells are modified with special receptors, known as chimeric antigen receptors or CARs. These new CAR T-cells are then injected back into a patient, where they will then bind to cancer cells and destroy them. Unlike chemotherapy, CAR T-cell therapy is more targeted against the bad cells.</p><p>Because of her diagnosis, and the fact that other treatments hadn’t worked, Larson was eligible for CAR T-cell therapy. After the FDA approval in Fall 2017, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at UW worked with various departments in the hospital to construct plans to safely implement and offer this therapy to patients. Larson says that while she was a little leery about being one of the first patients, she trusted Kenkre.</p><p>“I felt OK with it as long as she felt OK with it at that point,” Larson said.</p><p>In Summer 2018, the process got underway. The procedure to extract the cells was fairly straightforward. After that, Larson had three days of chemotherapy to prepare her body for the new, supercharged cells.</p><p>Then in September, Larson was admitted to the hospital to have the cells reinjected. For all the build-up, Larson says the actual procedure was rather anticlimactic. The following week in the hospital, required for CAR T-cell patients so doctors can monitor for side effects, was also fairly anticlimactic, right up until the night before her release. It was then she spiked a fever of 101, followed by horrible headaches. She was kept in the hospital for an additional week.</p><p>It was during that time in the hospital, however, that Larson began to notice a change. Prior to having the treatment, she could feel a large lump – the tumor – when touching her throat. That quickly began to change.</p><p>“You could feel it actually shrinking every day while I was there,” Larson said. “It was pretty incredible.”</p><p>An initial scan about a month after the treatment showed good results. Only a tiny spot was visible on the scan, likely some inflammation from the process.</p><p>Her next scan at three months officially showed a remission, though again, Larson had fear of using that word at that point. Regardless, Kenkre says that clear scan was a very good sign.</p><p>“We know that for patients who are in a remission at three months after CAR T therapy, there’s a very good chance that they will go on to not relapse,” she said.</p><p>Fast forward a year, and things are still looking good. Larson remains in remission and is now happily back to work, teaching music to students in the Pardeeville School District. After not having been able to teach full-time in over two years, she’s still getting back into the swing of things.</p><p>“It’s definitely wearing on me, because I’m not in the routine of teaching all day, but you know, it’s getting a little easier,” she said.</p><p>She’s also thrilled to once again be able to devote all her attention to her now 4-year-old daughter, who couldn’t possibly understand why her mom was often too tired to play with her during her cancer treatment.</p><p>Larson credits the support of her family and friends for getting her through some of the hardest years of her life.</p><p>As for Kenkre, she’s happy to see the real-life impact of a new and promising treatment, and the positive outcome it had for her patient.</p><p>“Not only is it wonderful that she’s hopefully cured, I’d like to think her quality of life is actually fairly good for all she had to go through, which speaks to the fact that this therapy can be hard in the short term, but patients can go on to make a good recovery,” Kenkre said.</p><p>When CAR T-cell therapy comes up in conversation now, some people have questions for Larson, while others comment that they’ve heard good things about the treatment.</p><p>“And I’m like, &#39;Well, I’m living proof of it so far,&#39; ” she said. “It’s helped me, so I’m sure it could help a lot of other people.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>When Heidi Gonzales talks about how the ketogenic diet has helped her daughter, Brandi, one word comes up over and over: miracle.</p><p>\r\r“It’s a miracle, and I just wish I would have tried it sooner,” Heidi says.\r\n \r\n\rBrandi was born with Rett Syndrome, a rare genetic disease that only affects girls because it comes from a mutation on the X chromosome. (Boys with the disease die shortly after birth). Brandi has the most severe form of the disease. Seizures are one of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r“She didn’t have her first seizure until she was 3, and they were mostly under control until around age 10 or 11,’’ Heidi says.\r\n\r\n\rFrom there, Brandi’s seizures kept escalating and she tried, and failed, to control them with at least four different medications. She had a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implanted, and that failed to stop the seizures. By her later teen years, she was frequently hospitalized with status epilepticus, a condition of unrelenting seizures.\r\n\r\nBrandi was transferred from the hospital in her hometown of Beloit to St. Mary’s in Madison, where doctors worked for hours to end her life-threatening seizures. Her doctor commented that the next time, the seizures might be fatal.\r\n\r\n“We were desperate, and we had run out of options,’’ Heidi says, when her daughter’s doctor suggested making an appointment with Dr. Elizabeth Felton, an epilepsy neurologist at UW Health who specializes in the keto diet. Heidi had heard of the diet, and of girls with Rett Syndrome who benefited from it, but she doubted that anything as simple as a diet change could help where the strongest medications and electrical implants didn’t.\r\n\r\nThey left Dr. Felton’s office with a keto diet starter kit paid for by Lily’s Fund, a local epilepsy charity. Inside the bag, she found recipes from the keto diet cooking classes offered by UW Health; educational materials; cookbooks; ketone test strips; ketogenic product samples donated by companies; and molds for “keto fat bombs.” These are one of Brandi’s favorite treats and feature healthy fats such as peanut butter and cream cheese flavored with cocoa and no-carb sweeteners.\r\n\r\nAfter going on the modified Atkins diet, which allows 20 net carbs a day, in December 2017, Brandi is nearly seizure free and has reduced two of her four seizure medications by half. Again, that word from her mom: “It was a miracle. I never expected that much improvement.”\r\n\r\nHeidi Gonzales went on the diet with her daughter and has lost 20 pounds and finds that it helps with her type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\n“I feel mentally sharper, and she is, too. She’s much sharper,’’ Heidi says.\r\n\r\n Her daughter has reached age 20, an age that many girls with Rett don’t make. She’s still walking, with assistance, can sit up and can still eat without a feeding tube. Her favorite foods are zucchini lasagna and low-carb pizza made on low-carb flat bread. Heidi says the high-fat diet meshes well with her southern cooking background – a little bacon on green beans makes them even better.\r\n\r\n“I feed her lots of fats, but Brandi hasn’t had any side effects,’’ Heidi says. “I never expected so much improvement.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>A little boy&#39;s seizures – up to 150 per day – left his parents feeling almost hopeless. That&#39;s when a UW Health pediatric neurologist suggested a special diet that turned Parker&#39;s life around.</p><p>\rWhen their first son was born to Mark and Laura Pentecost, they were thrilled and delighted. But by the time Parker was 6 months old, Mark and Laura knew something was not right. At first, he could not sit up normally, and he made almost no sounds at all. \r</p><p>&quot;We started seeing strange things,&quot; says Laura. &quot;Parker would look off and stare. It was like he was seeing ghosts in the house that we couldn&#39;t see. He also would hold on to the furniture closely because he was not walking steady.&quot;\r</p><p>The Pentecosts, who live in Poplar Grove, Illinois, were referred to UW Health&#39;s American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison. When Parker was 18 months old, he saw <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6360</span>, MD, PhD, who found Parker to have low muscle tone and global developmental delay, being at about the 9-month level in gross motor, fine motor and language skills. Extensive genetic and metabolic tests were initiated, and a brain scan was performed.\r</p><p>In September 2012, when Parker was 3 years old, he had an extended inpatient video-EEG performed because of staring spells. This study required his doctors to work together to obtain approval. The study immediately showed he was having seizures where he would suddenly twitch (myoclonic seizures). In addition, he had seizures where he would suddenly lose muscle tone and then fall (drop seizures). This combination of seizure types suggested a diagnosis of Doose syndrome. Parker was then started on seizure medications.\r</p><p>Parker seemed at first to respond to his seizure medications, for periods of time.\r</p><p>&quot;Then all hell broke loose,&quot; recalls Laura. &quot;The seizures became more frequent and more intense. He would fall to the floor for no reason. He would repeatedly jerk his head forward and hit it on a table. He would stiffen up and fall backward like a tree that was chopped down. He had to start wearing a seizure helmet.&quot;\r</p><p>On a single day in December 2012, Laura vividly recalls Parker having 150 – no misprint – seizures.\r</p><p>&quot;It was horrible,&quot; she says. &quot;He went into a very serious episode called non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is a long stretch of seizures with only small gaps between each one.&quot;\r\nParker was again admitted to American Family Children&#39;s Hospital in Madison, on December 17, 2012, where plans were made to put him on a ketogenic diet.\r</p><p>&quot;Ketogenic therapy involves a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that can help many children with epilepsy,&quot; says Dr. Hsu. &quot;It is not easy for families, so we reserve it for children who do not respond to the usual anti-seizure medications. We thought Parker was a good candidate for this diet, because it seems to work especially well for children with Doose syndrome, although we wanted to see how he did on medications first.&quot;\r</p><p>Fortunately, ketogenic therapy helped Parker, although remained in the hospital for more than two weeks to recover, including Christmas Day. Dr. Hsu remembers feeling so sorry for this brave little boy that on Christmas, he brought his own daughter to visit Parker in the hospital, where she gave Parker and his older sister, Payton, a little present.\r</p><p>Ketogenic therapy helped Parker&#39;s seizure frequency drop from as many as 150 a day to one every few months.\r</p><p>&quot;We do not understand how ketogenic therapy works,&quot; says Dr. Hsu, &quot;but we believe that there are several mechanisms, including a direct anti-convulsant effect from a 10-carbon chain fatty acid, but also at least two other mechanisms involving other neurosignalling mechanisms that may take weeks to months to take effect. It can help cut seizures in half in about half of patients who try it, and virtually eliminate all seizures in about 5 to 10 percent of patients. Parker is in this lucky group.&quot;\r</p><p>For the first seven months on this diet, Laura and Mark prepared every meal for Parker with extreme precision, turning their kitchen into a virtual science laboratory.\r</p><p>&quot;Every ingredient has to be weighed to the gram,&quot; says Laura. &quot;And some of his meals were kind of gross, like one green bean with a half a stick of butter.&quot;\r</p><p>Parker began to improve but was still having seizures. The medical team suggested switching Parker to a feeding tube, with a diet of 90 percent fat, 5 percent carbs and 5 percent sugars. For the next three years, the Pentecosts never let their son see &quot;real&quot; food.\r</p><p>&quot;We never ate or cooked in front of Parker, and we never went to a restaurant,&quot; says Laura. &quot;It wasn&#39;t easy, but it&#39;s what you do for your kid.&quot;\r</p><p>Parker last had a seizure on June 8, 2013 and has not had another one since. After three years, Dr. Hsu and Parker&#39;s nutritionists felt enough time had passed to wean Parker off the ketogenic diet and the feeding tube. Many children retain the benefits even after coming off the diet.\r</p><p>It didn&#39;t take long before Parker started eating as if he was making up for lost time.</p><p>\r&quot;This kid eats like a grown man now,&quot; says Laura. &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;\r</p><p>Parker has also made great strides developmentally. Although he is still mostly nonverbal, he vocalizes more frequently. He is delightful, playful, and mischievous. His parents describe him as being incredibly well-adjusted emotionally. He enjoys school, where he is a fourth grader, and has a nurse assigned to him constantly.\r</p><p>In terms of genetic workup, Parker was found to have two genetic mutations, one in a sodium channel gene called SCN1A, which can cause a wide spectrum of epileptic conditions, including a more severe syndrome called Dravet syndrome, as well as Doose syndrome. His doctors have chosen to keep the diagnosis of Doose syndrome because of how well he has responded to ketogenic therapy.\r</p><p>The good news is that Parker, now 9, has not had a seizure in more than 5 years. However, his neurologist has noticed increased activity on his EEG and asked his parents if they&#39;d be willing to try a less restrictive form of ketogenic therapy called the low glycemic index therapy (LGIT). His parents prefer to be more proactive in Parker&#39;s therapies and they agreed.\r</p><p>What would his parents like people to know about Parker now?\r</p><p>&quot;Parker loves books and cars and really especially loves noises – like a zip, zoom, crack or buzz,&quot; says Laura. &quot;He also loves basketball and just watching people. He doesn&#39;t scream or yell. He is filled with so much joy and shares love and laughs with everyone he meets.&quot;\r\n</p>",

A co-worker is recovering from multiple surgeries following a head-on car collision. Or perhaps you are healing after being hospitalized for an aneurysm or stroke.</p><p>Imagine, for a moment, however, the psychological trauma you might experience if suddenly you were unable to do something you probably do unconsciously every day.</p><p>It&#39;s something that countless recording stars have sung about — from Tony Bennett to Tim McGraw to Katy Perry.</p><p>It says you are friendly, trustworthy, confident and cooperative.</p><p>It lights up a room and makes others feel happy to see you.</p><p>It&#39;s your smile — and for some people, it&#39;s impossible.</p><p>&quot;People form impressions about you in a split second based on your face,&quot; says <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9993</span>, a physical therapist with the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C978</span>. &quot;If you can&#39;t smile on one side because of facial paralysis, other people tend to judge you, often making incorrect assumptions,&quot; said Jodi, and expert in neuromuscular retraining therapy. They look at you strangely and wonder what&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s not fair, but patients we see experience it all the time and it takes a huge emotional toll.&quot;</p><p>One of Jodi&#39;s patients, Kayla Stankowski, knows this sense of isolation all too well. Born with right-sided facial paralysis 31 years ago, Kayla remembers the jarring looks and belittling comments that started as far back as she can remember.</p><h3>Facial paralysis made Kayla feel like an outcast</h3><p>&quot;I got made fun of in school,&quot; she recalled. &quot;It&#39;s a reminder that you are different in a way most kids never know.&quot;</p><p>Forcefully determined to succeed, Kayla never let her physical condition knock her off the path she chose to pursue.</p><p>An inveterate school athlete — she played basketball, soccer and ran cross country — Kayla graduated from Winona State University in Minnesota in 2010. For the past 10 years, she has worked as an athletic trainer, personal trainer and group fitness instructor.</p><p>As a child, Kayla and her family pursued multiple paths, such as speech pathology and acupuncture, hoping for improvement. Nothing really worked. By the time she reached adulthood, Kayla was resigned to life with an asymmetrical smile and the unwelcome scrutiny that came along with it.</p><p>With unresponsive cheek muscles that prevented her from smiling on the right side, she taught herself how to mimic a fuller smile as best she could using normal function in her lip and lower face. It may not have looked natural, but it sent the all-important social cues people respond to after seeing somebody smile.</p><h3>Sister told Kayla about helpful procedure</h3><p>It wasn&#39;t until her early 20&#39;s when Kayla first heard about a potentially helpful surgical procedure called facial nerve graft. It was her older sister, then a student at the <a href=\"https://www.med.wisc.edu/\">University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health</a>, who first told Kayla about the procedure.</p><p>&quot;Initially, Kayla wasn&#39;t all that interested, but eventually she became more intrigued,&quot; said Trista Stankowski-Drengler, MD, now in her fifth year of General Surgery residency training at UW Health, with hopes of specializing in abdominal surgery.</p><p>Finally, at age 29, Kayla made the 4-hour trip from northwestern Wisconsin to the Facial Nerve Clinic in Madison, led by UW Health facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9437</span>, MD. Kayla and her family met with Facial Nerve Clinic team, including program coordinator Kari McConnell, RN, to come up with a comprehensive plan.</p><p>&quot;With Kayla&#39;s case of facial nerve paralysis, she had difficulty closing her right eye, breathing through her nose, and chewing foods like an apple or corn on the cob,&quot; said Dr. Chaiet. &quot;Far and away, though, her greatest pain — more emotional than physical — came from not being able to smile. Her condition prevented her from moving the cheek muscles that lift the corners of her mouth.&quot;</p><p>By December 2019, Kayla opted for the facial nerve graft procedure her sister told her about, which was jointly performed by Dr. Chaiet and <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8683</span>, MD, a UW Health otolaryngology — head and neck surgeon.</p><p>&quot;We connected the facial nerve on the side of Kayla&#39;s paralysis to the nerve of the masseter muscle, which activates chewing,&quot; said Dr. Wieland. &quot;Our hope was that this new connection would trigger a better electrical impulse, creating more facial motion where she had almost none.&quot;</p><p>In the event this procedure doesn&#39;t produce the amount of smile Kayla desires, Drs. Wieland and Chaiet did some extra work in the operating room to lay the groundwork for a complex future surgery that restores even more movement through use of a muscle from her inner thigh.</p><h3>Physical therapist helps Kayla learn new muscle movements</h3><p>In the meantime, however, Kayla is working closely with Jodi, the UW Health physical therapist, to achieve a smile that doesn&#39;t take so much concentration and physical effort.</p><p>&quot;She comes to Madison once a month and we work on breaking down her old habits and learning new ones,&quot; said Jodi. &quot;She is very bright and really dedicated, so if she just continues to put forth the effort I&#39;ve already seen, Kayla should see improvement within the coming year.&quot;</p><p>Before specializing in facial nerve therapy, Jodi was trained at UW Health by Jackie Diels, an internationally known occupational therapist and leader in facial neuromuscular retraining.</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t offer our patients quick fixes or guarantee perfection,&quot; says Jackie, but most people we see put in the time and effort because, after all, it is their face,&quot; she said.</p><p>Now in private practice after 31 years at UW Health, Jackie believes that Kayla is in very good hands. &quot;I think she will do very well working with Jodi,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;Kayla has been through a lot, so I&#39;m excited for her. A more natural smile will mean the world to her.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>As a young doctor-in-training, Dr. Aji Djamali was fascinated by the idea that one person’s selfless gift could change another person’s life. </p><div></div><p></p><p>When he began his medical residency in France, he found a mentor he truly admired, Dr. Georges Mourad, a transplant nephrologist (kidney doctor) who frequently talked about the wonders of organ donation.</p><p>Aji went on to become a transplant nephrologist himself and lead programs at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15138</span> and served as chief of the division of nephrology in the departments of medicine and surgery at UW School of Medicine and Public Health. As he performed transplant evaluations on patients, an idea that had formed in his mind during medical school grew in importance the more patients he saw. He decided he wanted to donate one of his kidneys to someone who needed a transplant. “I wanted to ‘walk the walk’ and make a difference,” he says. </p><p>\r</p><div></div><p>\r\nThere were a few considerations that affected the timing: He and his wife, Shawn, had three young children, ages 6, 4 and 2, and a very busy life that left little room to undergo the elective surgery. Shawn supported his decision but asked that he wait until his children were grown before moving forward with his plan.</p><p>\r</p><div></div><h3>\r\nFinding their place</h3><p>In 2014, John Jartz was fervently researching his new diagnosis, polycystic kidney disease, an inherited disorder in which clusters of cysts on the kidneys cause them to enlarge and eventually stop working. He learned he would soon need to go on dialysis, a procedure that is necessary to remove waste products from blood. He and his wife, Kathy, started visiting renowned transplant centers in the Midwest in hopes of finding a nephrologist he could trust who would help him learn more about transplantation.\r\n\r\nThey talked to caregivers at one center, but quickly dismissed it because it was too “factory-like.” When they visited the UW Health Transplant Center, they spent four hours conversing with doctors and members of the transplant team—including Aji. John looked at Kathy as they were driving home to Barrington Hills, Illinois, and said, “We’re done. We found our place.” \r\n\r\nOver the next two years, John saw Aji during clinic appointments. They talked about how his disease was progressing, yes, but they also shared personal stories and discovered they had much in common, including the same sense of humor. Both men love to travel, and they swapped stories about the places they had been. \r\n\r\nThey were building a friendship.\r\n\r\r\nWhile Djamali had become very close to Jartz he felt his primary care should be transferred to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10075</span>, MD, a nephrologist at University Hospital who specializes in polycystic kidney disease.  John asked Aji to stay up-to-date on his care and whenever John came to Madison for an appointment, he requested that his friend, Aji, join his doctor, Gauri, for a visit or meal with him to talk about his care. “I was a big believer that having the two of them in the same room with Kathy and me was incredibly important, so I could learn more about my disease and treatment,” says John.\r\n\r\nThese informal meetings—which included plenty of good food and sharing about their personal lives—continued over the next several years, and by 2019, it was clear that John needed a kidney transplant. Studies have shown patients who receive kidneys from living donors have better outcomes than those who receive deceased donor kidneys, so John decided living donation was the way to go. Kathy wanted to be his donor, but she didn’t qualify because of health issues. John spread the word among family, friends and acquaintances that he was looking for a kidney donor and wrote a Facebook post telling his story. His blood type is B, which means that ideally, he was looking for a donor with the same somewhat rare blood type. Although he knew he could receive an O blood type donor kidney or participate in a kidney “swap” in which his donor gave to someone and John received a kidney in return, he hoped for a direct donation. \r\n\r\nAt the end of 2021, Aji informed John he was leaving UW Health to lead the department of medicine at Maine Medical Center. The friends met for one last meal to say goodbye, a difficult conversation given how close they had become. At the end, Aji told John he thought he knew someone with a B blood type who could be his donor. “I looked him in the eye and said, ‘It’s me,’” said Aji.</p><h3>\rWalking the walk\r\r</h3><p>John was speechless. He felt a close relationship with Aji but had never expected him to step up as a donor. Ultimately, there was a potential donor list of 10 people—including Aji, whose youngest daughter was in the middle of her freshman year of college. UW Health began evaluating the donors one at a time, and Aji learned he was almost a perfect match for John.\r\n\r\n“The matching is really important for how long the kidney will work,” says <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6906</span>, MD, Aji’s transplant surgeon and former colleague at UW Health. “Aji is a healthy guy, and he’s lived a healthy lifestyle. I would expect this beautiful kidney- that is so closely matched- to last many years, hopefully for the rest of John’s life.”\r\n\r\nWhile John, a retired attorney for Quaker Oats Company in Chicago, never had to undergo dialysis, his health had deteriorated over the years. Most of all, he felt extremely tired before the surgery. But he wasn’t anxious. “The UW Health Transplant Center is clearly one of the best programs in the country, and I had a great team behind me,” he says.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 29, Aji’s right kidney was removed through a small incision using a laparoscope. By the early afternoon Aji was relaxing in his room drinking a cup of cranberry juice, when John’s transplant surgeon, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8868</span>, Director of the UW Heath Transplant Center, released the clamps on his new kidney. It immediately began making urine. As Aji waits to return to full health, he wants to spread the word far and wide that organ donation is safe and the right thing to do.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow,” he says. “I have not hesitated a single second about whether I should donate my kidney. It’s very important to me that I live my life fully and share what is important to me. I want to inspire and encourage people.”   </p><p>\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Tommy Wraggs’ “daddy instincts” kicked in when he noticed a bulge in his 3-month-old son Kingston’s abdomen in January 2018. </p><div></div><p></p><p>Their pediatrician in La Crosse wasn’t exactly sure what was going on – Kingston’s body was swollen and puffy and his lab work was off, so she quickly called the experts at American Family Children’s Hospital for advice.</p><p>That was the beginning of an unbelievable and unpredictable journey for Tommy and Kingston with incredible twists and turns, a nearly two-year stay at American Family Children’s Hospital and the gift of a new kidney in June 2022.</p><p>UW Health Kids pediatric nephrologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9930</span>’s specialty training led him to diagnose Kingston with congenital nephrotic syndrome – a condition so rare, that Dr. Paloian, who is used to seeing “the unusual” thought he may go his entire career without ever seeing a case.</p><p>With nephrotic syndrome, the kidneys leak proteins essential for managing infections, regulating fluids in the body and promoting general growth and development. </p><p>For most kids, nephrotic syndrome is caused by an autoimmune disease that they usually grow out of with proper treatment. But Kingston had congenital nephrotic syndrome which meant his kidneys were physically broken and would never be able to filter out the bad stuff from his blood while keeping the good stuff his body needed to be healthy. </p><p>Tommy remembers, “The physician sent an ambulance to take Kingston to Madison and said, ‘you have to go now.’ And life has never been the same.”</p><h3>Kingston needed a great deal of care and time to grow</h3><p>A kidney transplant was inevitable, but Kingston’s body needed time to grow. Most kids’ bodies aren’t developed enough for a kidney transplant until they&#39;re about 2 years old. That meant an extraordinary medical protocol for Kingston that Tommy would need to manage as a single dad at home.</p><p>“I remember sitting down with Tommy and saying ‘Okay, you are in for a journey,’” said Dr. Paloian. “I said ‘This is going to be a long haul with Kingston, and it is going to be very rocky, and it&#39;s going to be very bumpy.’ I laid it all out, and Tommy was like, ‘Okay, let&#39;s do it. Where do we start? How do we do it?’ He didn’t even blink an eye. He just said, ‘All right, whatever, lay it on me.’”</p><p>And so it began. For nearly a year, Tommy gave Kingston 20 different medications by mouth or through an IV each day, managed G-tube feedings, and drove 2 ½ hours one way to Madison for monthly follow-up appointments. </p><h3>A near-death experience and nine months in the pediatric intensive care unit</h3><p>The extensive medical protocol worked for about the first year of Kingston’s life. “He was doing okay, but he wasn’t doing great,” recalls Dr. Paloian. “He had a couple of hospital stays here and there, but he just wasn’t progressing like we wanted him to. It was nothing specific; he just wasn’t growing, and his development wasn’t taking off.”</p><p>The next step was removing Kingston’s kidneys, first the right and then the left. For a few months after the surgeries, Kingston had dialysis at home and things seemed okay.</p><p>Then, one evening in September 2020, Tommy noticed that Kingston was uncomfortable and seemed restless – signs Tommy knew could be peritonitis, an inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen that acts as a natural filter.</p><p>Tommy took Kingston to the emergency room in Wausau, where they were now living. The local hospital told Tommy that Kingston would need a higher level of care than they could provide and recommended that he take him to Madison in the morning. But, as Tommy says, “My daddy instinct said, ‘take him now,’ so I drove him to American Family Children’s Hospital immediately.”</p><p>Tommy and Kingston arrived at 2 a.m. Fluids were leaking from the g-tube in Kingston’s side, and the situation became dire very quickly. Kingston went into cardiac arrest, but the physicians and nurses were able to revive him. </p><p>The team soon discovered that Kingston had developed another extremely rare condition; a flesh-eating bacterial infection where the G-tube met his stomach. He would spend the next nine months in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).</p><h3>A massive team effort with extra TLC from “Kingston’s mommies” – the nurses</h3><p>“It was a massive team effort,” says Dr. Paloian, who was one of four pediatric nephrologists caring for Kingston. They worked closely with their colleagues in infectious disease, surgery, and the pediatric intensive care unit team to determine the right constellation of care- including antibiotics and surgeries to clear out the infection- as well as other therapies to keep Kingston’s body functioning without kidneys.</p><p>“With a lot of surgeries, skilled doctors and nurses, a whole lot of prayer, and a bit of time, my son lived,” Tommy reflected. “To this day there are probably doctors that don’t know how.”</p><p>Though Tommy says he and Kingston are “fighters”, there’s one group of people neither of them could live without – the 30+ nurses Tommy affectionately calls “Kingston’s mommies.”</p><p>“He loves his nurses, and they love him,” says Tommy. “He gets two baths a day. One nurse braided his hair. They sing to him. They exercise with him. Sometimes he falls asleep in their arms. Not only were they there every step of the way for my child, but they also checked on me and my wellbeing countless times. They wanted to know if I’d eaten or slept, they took care of me when I was focused on caring for King.”</p><p>Dr. Paloian also tips his hat to the nursing team. “This was one of the sickest patients I&#39;ve seen in my career, and the nurses were absolutely heroic,” he says. “It was remarkable how they managed his incredibly complex medical regimen, the dialysis procedures and multiple trips to the operating room. The nurses were just flawless and how they were able to seamlessly transfer care between one another with his level of complexity is just mind-blowing. But then the other thing to see is the level of compassion that they had, and the connections that they made with Kingston, as the child, and then Tommy, as the parent.”</p><h3>A waiting game for a new kidney</h3><p>With the infection cleared and Kingston’s health relatively stable, he was moved from the PICU to the Medical Surgical Unit of the hospital. As he grew, the search for a new kidney began.</p><p>Often, children receive transplants from living donors – parents or other relatives who are usually young and healthy and are often a good match in terms of biochemistry. But unfortunately for Kingston, his multiple abdominal surgeries, antibodies and body size meant that finding the right kidney wouldn’t be easy. It was several more months, and many moments of hope followed by disappointment, until the perfect kidney was available.</p><p>In early June of 2022, Kingston got his new kidney, the ultimate gift of life. After all the bumps in the road to get Kingston to this point, the incredibly complex surgery and Kingston’s recovery went very smoothly.</p><p>With a new kidney to provide healthy blood with all the right proteins and nutrients to feed Kingston’s body, Tommy and the medical team noticed remarkable changes in him. Within a couple of weeks, they began to see Kingston’s personality come through as he became more interactive and chattier. He is getting physically stronger every day - he can now stand with support- and he is catching up on many other milestones he missed while being so sick.</p><h3>Leaving the children’s hospital</h3><p>On June 29, Kingston was discharged from inpatient care at the hospital. There were tears of joy and sadness as the care team gathered to say goodbye to the father and son.</p><p>“Kingston beat so many odds,” pediatric transplant surgeon, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5806</span> said. “First with his diagnosis, then with such a severe infection, and even just finding a kidney donor that could work for his size and complications, it is heartwarming to see him being discharged from the hospital.”</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8693</span>, one of Kingston’s nephrologists, is also happy to see him on his way home. “We sometimes didn’t think he would ever leave the PICU, or leave the hospital,” she said. “We don’t really use the word miracle in medicine, but Kingston is a miracle.”</p><p>Tommy says life outside the hospital will feel strange. “We are home at the hospital. I think we have squatter’s rights after two years of being here, so it feels weird to go home. I was only going home once every five months, so I feel like a stranger at my real home,” he says.</p><p>“We’re not saying goodbye to Kingston, we&#39;re just putting on a different hat,” says Dr. Paloian. He and the expert UW Health Kids kidney transplant team will continue to care for Kingston in this new phase of life post-transplant until he is an adult, when Kingston transitions to our adult transplant team who will follow him for the rest of his life to make sure his kidney keeps working.</p><p>Tommy is making plans to move to Madison so he and Kingston can be closer to the children’s hospital where Kingston and Tommy will also get psychosocial support and any additional specialized care Kingston needs to foster his personal growth and development. In the meantime, the pair will stay at the nearby Ronald McDonald House as they transition to life outside the hospital. </p><p>Dr. Paloian says he’s amazed by what Tommy has taken on as a single dad, but for Tommy, it’s all driven by a father’s love. “I can tell you that with such a different situation with King, I have to take a look at what he needs rather than me,” he says. “I know this much - that no matter what, it will be okay as long as I do right by him.”\r</p>",

Further testing confirmed the cancer diagnosis in March 2014.</p><p>The prognosis he was given was cut and dried, yielding not even a sliver of hope.   </p><div></div><p>“The local doctor told him it was time to get his affairs in order,” says Mary Jo. “We then saw an oncologist in Appleton who set my dad up with an appointment in Madison to see <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7871</span>,” a UW Health cancer surgeon. “Thank goodness we did.”</p><p>Pancreatic cancer, the third highest cause of cancer death, is so deadly because it can often spread early and is typically caught late. Four out of five cases have already spread beyond the pancreas at the time of diagnosis. Fortunately for Jack, his tumor was found earlier because it was pinching the bile duct that triggered his jaundice. </p><p>Because his tumor was confined to the head of the pancreas, he became a candidate for a highly complex surgery known as the Whipple, in which the surgeon removes part of the pancreas, the gallbladder and main bile duct and part of the intestine. Everything is then reconstructed during what is typically a five- to eight-hour procedure. </p><p>“Many patients in their 80s would not be strong enough to get through the surgery but Jack was fit enough,” says Dr. Weber. “We thought he would have a good outcome.”</p><p>Jack also was an early participant in a UW clinical trial that changed the way most UW Health patients are treated when first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>“We used to do the Whipple surgery before starting chemotherapy and radiation,” says Dr. Weber, “but thanks to clinical trial patients like Jack, we now see better results by giving chemotherapy and, if needed, radiation first, followed by surgery.”</p><p>There were some bumps in the road after surgery, but he got through them with an incredibly positive attitude and a dedicated advocate in his daughter Mary Jo, who usually drove her dad from Appleton to his appointments in Madison. </p><h2>Sense of humor worked in his favor</h2><p>“Dad always kept his sense of humor, even on the toughest days,” Mary Jo says. “Our favorite story was the day he walked into clinic with a surprise gift for the nurses.”</p><p>Reaching behind his back, Jack presented the nurses with a paper bag.</p><p>“I brought you one of my stool samples,” Jack said, reveling in the nurses’ flustered reaction.</p><p>Much to their relief, Jack pulled out several three-legged miniature wooden stools that he built at home with pieces from an old pool cue serving as the legs.</p><p>“My father had a way of finding joy, even when there was none,” Joe says. “Keeping people laughing always lightened the load.”</p><p>When Jack died in 2019 at age 88, it wasn’t pancreatic cancer, but a sudden onset of prostate cancer that took his life. Mary Jo and Joe, who still have their 90-year-old mother, Carol, miss their father but are extraordinarily grateful for nearly five extra years they had with Dad after his original diagnosis.</p><h2>Pancreas Cancer Prevention Program launched in 2020</h2><p>Because of the family history of pancreatic cancer — Jack’s sister had it and his mother, although never formally diagnosed, probably did too — Mary Jo and Joe are now themselves patients of the UW Health Pancreas Cancer Prevention Clinic, which keeps a close watch on individuals who are at higher risk of getting the disease. </p><p>“Only 10 to 12 percent of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer today are alive in five years,” says Dr. Rebecca Minter, a UW Health pancreaticobiliary surgeon and Chair of the UW Department of Surgery within the School of Medicine and Public Health. “Saying that we can’t do anything more for those patients at higher risk of developing pancreas cancer is simply unacceptable.”</p><p>Similar to a program she created at her prior institution before coming to Madison in 2018, Dr. Minter formed the Pancreas Cancer Prevention Clinic at UW Health, which launched in 2020. </p><p>“Historically,” says Dr. Minter, “there has been a sense that we can’t do anything to screen for pancreas cancer because it is, fortunately, still relatively rare. Still, there are patients with higher risk and our program’s aim is to prevent patients from getting pancreas cancer who otherwise would, or to detect it early,” says Dr. Minter. “If we can intervene when things look suspicious and prevent cancer from developing, we’ve made life-saving differences for people and their families like the Pankratzes. Most patients won’t need surgery like Jack, but knowing they are regularly checked provides less anxiety and more hope for those with increased risk.”</p><p>Patients who are candidates for the prevention program fall into one of two categories:</p><p>(1) People with an increased genetic risk for developing pancreas cancer, be it those with a strong family history like Mary Jo and Joe, or those with a genetic mutation than can lead to an increased risk of pancreas and other cancers (such as BRCA2).</p><p>(2) People with mucin-producing cysts in the pancreas. Most pancreatic cysts do not become cancerous but those that do can be lethal.</p><p>Pancreatic cysts are common, and most do not become cancerous. They are typically found when patients have imaging for other reasons – like appendicitis or kidney stones. Historically, pancreatic cysts have either been treated too aggressively or insufficiently.</p><h2>Prevention team monitors 1,200 patients</h2><p>Fortunately, UW Health has a team of experts from multiple specialties who review every pancreas abnormality identified on imaging as well as those patients with increased genetic risk. Each week, these specialists in pancreatic surgery, gastroenterology, radiology and genetics meet to review the ever-growing list of patients in the program. Experts from each of these fields carefully discuss options and recommendations, while keeping a close eye on concerning changes that might warrant more invasive testing or surgical treatment. Enid Erdman, the program’s nurse navigator, works closely with the doctors, nurses and more than 1,200 patients who are being followed. </p><p>Pancreas Cancer Prevention Clinics may exist in various forms, but UW Health is one of only a very few that have invested the required resources to ensure that every potentially high-risk patient in its system is identified, contacted and enrolled in a tailored surveillance or treatment plan.</p><p>“We are so grateful this program exists, not only for ourselves but for our  seven children and four grandchildren that my brother and I have,” says Mary Jo. “We also remain grateful beyond words for the 1,800 extra days we had with our Dad to love him, hug him and say, ‘I love you,’” says Mary Jo. </p><p>Joe can’t say enough about the professionalism and kindness his family witnessed at UW Health. “There was so much empathy and proactive energy to help our dad,” he says. “As a former president of the Wisconsin Jewelers Association, I’d call our experience a real gem.”\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>When Melissa Nelson first began experiencing the signs of diabetes (frequent urination, thirst and weight loss) at age 23, she told herself it couldn’t possibly be diabetes.</p><p>She figured she was too old for a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis, and too small for Type 2.</p><p>Melissa was working as a technician in a hospital emergency department, and one day, an ER doctor smelled ketones on her breath. Ketones are chemicals the body creates when it breaks down fat to use for energy and are a warning sign that a person’s diabetes is out of control. Some people say that “ketone breath” spells fruity, or like nail polish remover. After the doctor smelled her breath, he admitted her right away. Sure enough, she received a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis and started insulin injections.</p><p>Over the next 10 years, Melissa worked hard to regulate her blood sugar. She participated in 5K races and even was able to become pregnant and give birth to a son. But it was difficult—especially since she suffered from a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness, a complication of diabetes in which the patient is unaware of a deep drop in blood sugar. She averaged one or two intensive care unit stays each year, and nearly lost consciousness one day at work while she was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p>Though Melissa works in health care, she never knew it was possible to undergo a pancreas-only transplant; she thought pancreas transplants only happened in conjunction with kidney transplants. Then, she met someone in her hometown of Davenport, Iowa, whose son received a pancreas transplant at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin.</p><p>Melissa connected with the caregivers at the UW Health Pancreas Transplant Program, and by April 2019, she was on the wait list for a new pancreas. She was only on the list for 36 hours before she received a call that a pancreas had become available. She drove from Iowa to Wisconsin and received her gift of life on April 25, 2019.</p><p>After the transplant Melissa developed several complications, including blood clots in the donor artery that almost caused her to lose her new pancreas. But she fought through with the help of the UW Health team. “I was in the best care,” she says. “My transplant surgeon, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7050</span>, was phenomenal, my transplant coordinator, Nancy, was amazing, and the team that cared for me on the hospital floor was wonderful.”</p><p>She remembers one instance when she and her husband, Jake, received bad news while they were in the hospital. One of her nurses sat with her, hugged her and cried right along with her.</p><p>While the complications were difficult, Melissa is thrilled she received her transplant. Now, she can play with her 7-year-old son without worrying about her blood sugar level. “It was 100% worth it,” she says. “I consider this a gift, and the pain I went through isn’t comparable with the pain the donor’s family went through.”</p><p>Since her transplant, Melissa has run in a couple of races, and she will compete in the 2022 Donate Life Transplant Games in San Diego, California. She has also become an active volunteer with the Iowa Donor Network. “It’s a ripple effect,” she says. “You never really know how the person you are talking to may be affected by organ donation.”</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Only a herculean effort by nearly 50 UW Health doctors</b> and their teams of nurses, therapists and coordinators could have saved the life of 24-year-old Daniel Milburn when he was suddenly transported by Med Flight from Gundersen Health in La Crosse, Wis. to University Hospital in late March 2021. His incredible story – which culminated in an extraordinarily rare heart-and-double-lung transplant on Easter Sunday – is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>A native of Louisiana, Daniel moved to Wisconsin in 2019 to work for the Ashley Furniture assembly plant in Arcadia, Wis., not far from La Crosse. Other than a lifelong asthma condition and some fainting episodes after becoming lightheaded, Daniel was a seemingly healthy young man who almost instantly found himself hanging on for life. It wasn’t immediately clear that he would need a new heart and lungs, but once all other medical options were exhausted, the race was on to save Daniel. Thankfully, he was in the right place, given the stellar reputation of the UW Health Transplant Center – known across the nation for both shorter-than-average wait times for new organs and excellent outcomes.</p><p>\rDr. Jason Lai, the UW Med Flight physician whose crew transported Daniel to Madison, remembers hoping for the best but fearing the worst.\n\r\n“When we picked up Daniel in La Crosse, he was in critical condition with blood clots in his lungs,” he says. “As Med Flight physicians, we usually don’t find out what happens with our patients once we drop them off. It was quite a miracle that Daniel pulled through.”\n\r\nWhen he arrived at University Hospital, several UW Health teams -- including heart transplant, lung transplant, heart failure and critical care -- began attending to Daniel. After hours of tests, they discovered yet more pulmonary blood clots that had caused irreversible damage.\r\n\r</p><h3>Blood clots in lungs put Daniel in great danger\n\r</h3><p>“The clots in Daniel’s lungs put tremendous pressure on his heart, causing right-sided heart failure,” says UW Health’s Dr. Malcom DeCamp, Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery, who took the initial call from Gundersen and arranged for Daniel’s transfer.\n\r\nAll of the medical teams spent hours consulting not only with each other, but with colleagues around the nation determining whether any form of treatment short of a multi-organ transplant was feasible. His unusually grave condition, known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, often goes undiagnosed for years before the body sounds its emergency alarms.\n\r\n“Our hypothesis is that Daniel’s blood was genetically predisposed to clot where it normally shouldn’t, namely inside the blood vessels in his lungs,” says Dr. Daniel McCarthy, Surgical Director of Lung Transplant at UW Health. “Once we saw how much clotting there was, we had no choice but to put Daniel on ECMO in hopes of stabilizing him.”\n\r\nECMO, which stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is a last-resort artificial heart-and-lung machine to keep critically ill patients alive. It was used frequently to sustain many very sick COVID-19 patients, but otherwise is used only when other measures are exhausted.\r\nFortunately, ECMO settled Daniel’s situation and helped restore consciousness so he could speak with his care providers and his mother, Ronda Miller, who had just flown in from California, where she was working.\n\r\n“The last thing I remember,” says Daniel, “was lying in the hospital in La Crosse. After a three-day coma, I woke up on Good Friday and saw my mom in the room. Thinking she was still in California, I knew something was severely wrong.”</p><h3>Daniel thought doctors had to be talking about another patient</h3><p>Daniel’s hunch was confirmed when doctors told him he needed to be placed on the wait list for a heart-and-lung transplant.\n\r\n“When I heard them say ‘transplant,’” Daniel says. “I thought they were talking to the wrong patient.”\n\r\nHis mother also was astounded beyond words.\n\r\n“I had just spoken to Daniel on the phone the day before he went to the hospital in La Crosse,” Ronda says. “It was inconceivable to hear that he might not live. Thankfully, everyone at UW Health was so comforting and said they would do whatever it took for him. There were so many nurses, transplant coordinators and therapists who spent hours with us and they had an answer for every question, which gave me total confidence.”\n\r\nAs the magnitude of Daniel’s illness became clear, only one path to survival emerged -- a new heart and lungs. Only 40 heart/lung transplants are done in the U.S. each year and even if new organs became available quickly, there was no guarantee of survival. Daniel’s situation was indeed dire enough to move him near the top of the wait list, but nobody could predict how soon matching organs would become available. Solid organs are almost always in short supply because more patients need organs than there are people who have chosen to become organ donors.</p><h3>\rNew heart and lungs arrived in one day</h3><p>Patients in need of a new organ can wait days, weeks or even months, but as if scripted in Hollywood, Daniel’s prayers were answered the very next day -- Easter Sunday. He calls it a blessing, not a coincidence to be offered a heart and two lungs from the same donor who made the gift of life. The successful 8-hour surgery was performed by five UW Health cardiothoracic surgeons, including Dr. Jason Smith, Director of Cardiothoracic Transplant, who recovered the organ block from the donor.\n\r\n“The new heart and lungs worked well right away,” says Dr. Amy Fiedler, one of the heart transplant surgeons who cared for Daniel. “It was all hands on deck for Daniel and there was great teamwork across the board.”\n\r\nAfter spending just 2½ weeks in the hospital following the surgery, Daniel moved into a Madison apartment so he can be close to his care team. He works in the hospitality field and continues to get stronger over time while adhering to an exercise regimen.\n\r\n“Daniel is recovering wonderfully,” says Dr. Erin Lowery, a UW Health transplant pulmonologist and medical director of the Lung Transplant Program. “When you consider how little time he had to prepare for this ordeal, it’s really extraordinary. Having his mom there for him has been an enormous source of support and strength. His prognosis for a fairly normal life is quite good.”\n\r\nDaniel and Ronda cannot express how grateful they are not only for the quality of care at UW Health, but for the organ donor and their family who gave Daniel a second chance at life.</p><h3>Becoming a donor could save another life like Daniel’s</h3><p>“I will treat these gifts with the greatest possible respect and love,” Daniel says.” He also encourages those who have not become an organ donor to reconsider.\n\r\n“You or your loved one could be in the same place I was,” he says. “You will want someone to donate for you the way somebody did for me.”  Anyone can register to become a donor by visiting <a href=\"https://www.organdonor.gov\">organdonor.gov</a>.\n\r\nDr. Lowery says Daniel’s case beautifully illustrates how a multitude of physicians, nurses, therapists, coordinators and other caregivers were unshakably united on Daniel’s behalf.\n\r\n“Daniel’s survival is a great testament to the breadth and depth of UW Health broadly and our Transplant Programs specifically,” says Lowery. “We are incredibly proud to see our heart transplant, lung transplant, heart failure, ECMO and critical care teams come together on behalf of this young man who had some bad luck but whose gratitude cannot be overstated.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Your heart really has no choice. It simply melts once you meet a precious little girl named Kaliyah Nelson of Janesville, Wis. \r</p><p>As a descriptor, “adorable” doesn’t really do this 2-year-old child justice. Her infectious smile, big eyes and sweet personality are impossible to resist.</p><p>Kaliyah gives everyone she meets immense pleasure. Sadly, however, this delightful toddler has experienced all too much pain. Born in July 2019 and diagnosed on Day 4 of life with sickle cell anemia, Kaliyah was symptom-free until she was 5 months old.</p><p>“That’s when her energy level dropped, she stopped eating and everything flared up,” said Kaliyah’s mother, Shyniece Jackson.</p><p>An inherited red blood disorder, sickle cell anemia is named after the abnormally shaped red blood cells whose crescent shape resembles a sickle harvesting tool. The genetic sickle cell trait – not the disease itself – is found in about 10 percent of all African Americans in the United States, although it is also found in Hispanics, South Asians, Caucasians from southern Europe, and people from Middle Eastern countries. If both parents have the trait, each child has a one in four chance of getting sickle cell anemia.</p><p>“Some children, like Kaliyah, have more severe symptoms and some less so,” said UW Health Kids pediatric hematologist/oncologist Carol Diamond, MD, who cares for Kaliyah.</p><p>“Normal blood cells are disc shaped, so they flow freely throughout the bloodstream for most of us. People with sickle cell anemia get sick because the abnormally shaped sickle cells tend to get stuck inside blood vessels,” she said. “When this happens, oxygen delivery to tissues is compromised.”</p><h3>Many symptoms of sickle cell anemia\r</h3><p>Depending on the severity of sickle cell disease, said Dr. Diamond, symptoms can include:\r</p><ul><li><p>Fatigue – a result of the anemia, or shortage of red blood cells\r</p></li><li><p>Pain crises that can last hours or weeks; these frequently occur in the chest, abdomen, joints and bones</p></li><li><p>Swelling in the hands and feet, also caused by insufficient blood flow</p></li><li><p>Frequent infections due to a patient’s spleen not working well or at all\r</p></li></ul><p>Sickle cell anemia is only cured by bone marrow transplant – often an unavailable option – but patients can grow and thrive normally with proper medical care and a supportive home environment. Fortunately, new gene editing therapies – such as one called CRISPR – are showing great promise.</p><p>“Stress management is incredibly important for these kids,” said Dr. Diamond. “This is a tough disease for any child and family, but it’s a lot more manageable when there is a safe, stable home environment.”</p><p>Over the past year, Shyniece has taken this to heart and tried to make her daughter’s life as normal as possible, notwithstanding several hospitalizations and blood transfusions.\r</p><p>“It’s not easy as a single parent,” she said, noting that her other daughter, LaZaria, 9, also needs her share of motherly attention. “It can be heartbreaking at times, but normally Kaliyah is such a happy, active and smiling child.”\r</p><p>From mid-2019 through mid-2020, Kaliyah experienced a steady stream of pain crises. As hard as she tried, Shyniece’s ability to handle the stress of the situation began to wane.\r</p><h3>While not a cure, spleen removal could help\r</h3><p>By Fall 2020, Dr. Diamond and her team at UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital sat down with Shyniece to discuss the idea of removing Kaliyah’s spleen, an important organ located in the upper left part of the belly.</p><p>“The spleen helps fight infection by filtering germs out of the bloodstream,” said Dr. Diamond. “With children like Kaliyah, the sickle-shaped cells get trapped in the spleen, causing that organ to enlarge and, in turn, trigger anemia and pain. Over time, the spleen eventually shrinks and dies. For Kaliyah, we recommended removal of her spleen as a way to prevent dangerous episodes of worsened anemia and keep her out of the hospital.&quot;</p><p>After talking with Shyniece, Dr. Diamond referred Kaliyah to UW Health Kids pediatric surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9349</span>, MD, who performed the surgery – called a splenectomy – at American Family Children’s Hospital in early November. \r</p><p>“Kaliyah did great with the surgery,” said Dr. Leys. “We do this procedure laparoscopically through a small incision in her belly button so she won’t have a visible scar. She was doing well and her belly button looked completely normal when I saw her a couple of weeks after surgery.”</p><h3>Penicillin will help fight off infections\r</h3><p>The spleen stops working normally in all children with sickle cell anemia early on, so they start taking penicillin upon diagnosis. To compensate for her missing spleen – one of the body’s natural infection-fighting organs – Kaliyah will stay on daily penicillin for the rest of her life. She also received several vaccines before the surgery to help boost her immunity.</p><p>“They told me kids who have their spleen taken out are typically older than Kaliyah, but it got to the point where I just couldn’t see my child in such pain anymore,” said Shyniece. “Taking out her spleen is not a cure, but she is a lot more like her regular self.”</p><p>Thinking back to when Kaliyah was born, Shyniece thought about moving back to her hometown of Chicago to be closer to family. Once her baby was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, however, Shyniece decided that being close to her UW Health Kids care team was in her daughter’s best interest.\r</p><p>“They know Kaliyah from A to Z in Madison,” Shyniece said. “When I call and tell them she isn’t smiling, they know something is wrong and help me figure out what to do next.”</p><p><span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11357</span>, NP, a UW Health Kids pediatric hematology/oncology nurse practitioner who works with Dr. Diamond, cherishes how valuable these long-term relationships are to each family.\r</p><p>“We see these patients at their worst and at their best, so this allows us to provide great reassurance when a mom like Shyniece is on the phone not sure what to do,” Weier said.\r</p><p>For Shyniece, getting through each day is a major juggling act, so a comforting voice like Kari’s can mean a world of difference.\r</p><p>“It’s the greatest, most comforting feeling,” Shyniece said. “Because they know Kaliyah and me so well, I can rest easier after checking in.”</p><p></p><p>\r</p>",

About 1,025 babies in the U.S. are born with it each year.</p><p>&quot;Babies with this defect have a severely underdeveloped left ventricle, meaning they essentially function with half a heart,&quot; says Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10310</span>, a UW Health pediatric cardiologist at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital. &quot;Forty years ago, very few of these babies survived past the first month but today their outlook is much better, thanks to the evolution of a surgical and medical care plan that has stood the test of time.</p><p><a href=\"https://uwhealth.formstack.com/forms/uwhrequest_an_appointment_with_a_pediatric_heart_specialist\"></a>Despite the shocking diagnosis, getting the news midway through her pregnancy gave Rachael, an accountant, and Brent, a dairy farmer, plenty of time to learn and plan for the intensive treatment plan that lay ahead.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m a planner,&quot; Rachael says. &quot;We didn&#39;t waste much time before I started researching children&#39;s hospitals and pediatric heart surgery programs.&quot;</p><p>Babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome require three separate surgeries that significantly re-work the heart&#39;s &quot;plumbing&quot; to optimize the blood flow. The first operation, called the Norwood, is exceptionally complex and is typically performed within the first two weeks of life. About 15 percent of babies do not survive the operation. The two subsequent surgeries typically occur around six months of age (Glenn Procedure) and 3 to 4 years (Fontan Procedure).</p><h3>Shopping for a children&#39;s hospital</h3><p>Residents of tiny Charlotte, Iowa, a town of 300 located 35 miles north of Davenport, Iowa, the Blanchards decided to shop around for a children&#39;s hospital in which they felt complete confidence.</p><p>&quot;It was the summer of 2019 and the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings had just come out,&quot; recalls Rachael. &quot;The children&#39;s heart program at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital was ranked highly and that kind of struck my eye, so we decided to make a visit to Madison.&quot;</p><p>With her insurance company steering the Blanchards elsewhere, Rachael called American Family Children&#39;s Hospital herself and asked for the pediatric heart surgery program.</p><p><span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9052</span>, a pediatric heart surgery nurse practitioner, remembers taking the call.</p><p>&quot;Rachael comes on the line and says, ‘I&#39;m pregnant with a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome,&#39; &quot; Kari recalls. &quot;&#39;Can you tell me how I get a visit with you?&#39; &quot;</p><p>Ten days later, the Blanchards were on their way to Madison, about 2½ hours from home. Their appointment was in an exam room located in the cardiology hallway, which is decorated in a cow theme.</p><p>&quot;As a dairy farmer, my husband thought this might be a good sign,&quot; Rachael says. Their first impression only got better once the family had a chance to meet the care team.</p><h3>Highly impressed by the UW Health team</h3><p>&quot;Kari Nelson was amazing,&quot; Rachael says, &quot;She talked with us, not to us. Then we met Dr. A and Dr. Josh,&quot; she says, referring to Drs. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8971</span> and <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10588</span>, the two UW Health pediatric heart surgeons who would eventually operate on their baby - whom they named Boone. &quot;They answered all of our questions very thoroughly and told us to take some time before making a decision. Brent and I just looked at each other and said, &#39;We don&#39;t need any time.&#39; &quot;</p><p>What the Blanchards needed, however, was Rachael&#39;s incredible planning skills to ensure she and her husband would be in the right place at the right time once she was ready to give birth.</p><p>&quot;With all of Boone&#39;s anticipated care needs, and my history of delivering our first child, Valerie, several weeks early, I could not be giving birth on the side of the road,&quot; she says.</p><p>Thirty-four weeks into Boone&#39;s pregnancy, Rachael and Brent packed up and moved into a hotel room in Dodgeville, Wis. – a city less than an hour from Madison but still close enough to home, where 19-month-old Valerie was cared for by Brent&#39;s mom and Rachael&#39;s sister. After three weeks, Rachael and Brent moved to a Madison hotel and two days later, Boone was born at UnityPoint Health - Meriter on Sept. 11, 2019. (UnityPoint Health – Meriter is a nearby partner hospital in mother-baby care.)</p><p>&quot;The birthing and neonatology teams did a wonderful job of stabilizing Boone that first day and night,&quot; says Dr. Hoyme. &quot;By day two, we transferred him to American Family Children&#39;s Hospital, with the first open heart surgery to come just a few days later.&quot;</p><h3>Heart surgery on fifth day of life</h3><p>On day five of life, Dr. Anagnostopoulos, Dr. Hermsen and the pediatric heart surgery team took Boone to the operating room, where they would begin to re-work his little, walnut-sized heart.</p><p>&quot;I was a lot less anxious than I thought I&#39;d be,&quot; Rachael says. &quot;After all the planning, it was now up to the medical team and we had all the faith in the world in them.&quot;</p><p>Following the 8-hour operation, the next few days would be critical. Typical for this procedure, the surgeons left Boone&#39;s chest open for a few days following surgery to make sure the heart and lungs would not get too compressed from the swelling that is normal after surgery.</p><p>&quot;We closed him up after three days without any problems,&quot; Anagnostopoulos said. &quot;From a cardiac and blood flow perspective, he did great.&quot;</p><p>Unfortunately, Boone would prove to be very fussy eater. He would spit up frequently and never took to a pacifier or bottle. Accordingly, he had a semi-permanent feeding tube placed, and with the help of UW Health experts in gastroenterology, nutrition and speech, Boone arrived home six weeks after surgery.</p><p>By the time he turned five months old, Boone was ready for the second (Glenn) heart operation in the three-surgery sequence. Between the first and second surgeries, the family recorded his weight, oxygen saturation level and feedings through a phone app that transmits the data to the hospital.</p><p>&quot;The time between surgeries is referred to as the interstage period,&quot; says Dr. Hoyme. &quot;Our interstage home monitoring program helps families like Boone&#39;s stay in close contact with us should any potential warning signs emerge. Our goal is for these babies to arrive for their second surgery as healthy and safe as possible.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, Boone recovered much faster after his second surgery, coming home after 13 days of hospitalization. The third and final procedure will probably happen sometime in Boone&#39;s fourth year of life.</p><h3>Entire UW Health team did its part</h3><p>Despite the complexity of the surgery he performs, Anagnostopoulos – commonly called &quot;Dr. A&quot; – credits the entire system of care for Boone&#39;s very positive outlook.</p><p>&quot;Babies like this can only thrive with the right prenatal diagnosis, the right perinatal care, the right delivery, the right transport, the right anesthesia and surgery, the right pediatric ICU care, and the right cardiology and interstage care,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;m proud that this program performed at a high level, because you can&#39;t have a gap anywhere along the line.&quot;</p><p>Months later, life at the Blanchard home has calmed down a bit. As Boone approaches his first birthday in September 2020, his parents reflect on the amazing journey this family has been on since first getting the diagnosis.</p><p>&quot;Something I&#39;ll never forget, was when Boone was struggling a lot with his feeding,&quot; Rachael says. &quot;Dr. A. came into the room and started teasing us because we&#39;re big Chicago Bears fans and the Bears were struggling at the time.&quot;</p><p>Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky &quot;has plenty of potential,&quot; Anagnostopoulos would say, looking at baby Boone in his Bears hat. &quot;Trubisky just needs a little more time to put it all together, just like Boone.&quot;</p><p>Knowing that Anagnostopoulos remembered the Trubisky story reminded Rachael exactly why her family felt so comfortable at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital.</p><p>&quot;Some people were a little surprised that we came to Madison,&quot; says Rachael. &quot;You just have to trust your &#39;mom gut&#39; and go where it&#39;s best for your family. We know UW doesn&#39;t have the largest children&#39;s heart program in the country, but we come from a town of 300 and don&#39;t need big flashy things. We just wanted a place with warm, wonderful people who don&#39;t brag about their success, but just live it.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>Mark Scotch never dreamed that a casual chat in a microbrewery would turn into a life-changing experience.</p><p>Mark and his wife Lynn are active people and avid travelers. It was on a trip through Louisiana when they stopped at a microbrewery so Mark, who sells hops, could chat with the brewer. It was a conversation with the guy relaxing on the next barstool that changed his life. </p><p>“I’m enjoying a nice chat with a guy named Hugh Smith and he says he has to leave to go home and do his dialysis,” says Mark. </p><p>After a few more questions Mark learned that Hugh had been doing peritoneal dialysis for several months and needed a kidney transplant. “The next thing I knew,” says Mark, “I was saying ‘I’ll give you a kidney.’”  </p><p>Mark knew about living kidney donation because his sister-in-law donated her kidney. “I knew it was possible, and a good thing to do,” says Mark. “I just hadn’t thought of doing it before because I’m very active with my long-distance biking, but right then and there I thought ‘now is a good time.’”</p><p>Mark called Hugh’s nurse coordinator while traveling, and again a few months later when he was back home in Wisconsin. He also studied living donation on the internet. Mark read about the National Kidney Registry (NKR) on the UW Health website. UW Health is the largest center in the NKR program and Mark wanted to do his donation in Madison, closer to home. His only remaining concern was his health post-donation. </p><p>“I don’t consider my activity level to be normal,” says Mark. “I wanted to know if other ultra-athletes had donated, and was relieved to connect with Kidney Donor Athletes,” a group formed by Tracy Hulick, an ultra-marathoner who also donated at UW Health. Mark read her story and called her. “She gave me the confidence I needed that all would be fine.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Hugh transferred his care to a transplant center in Mississippi that is also affiliated with the NKR. </p><p>During his evaluation, Mark learned about the NKR’s voucher program, which allowed him to donate his kidney to the person it matched best, at the time that worked best for Mark, and for Hugh to receive a kidney that was better matched to him. </p><p>“At first, Hugh was sad,” says Mark, “He wanted <i>my</i> kidney. But once he learned that he would get a better-matched kidney and my kidney would help someone else too, he was fine with the idea.”  </p><p>Prior to his donation, Mark decided to take his last ‘two-kidney’ ride on his bike when he trekked 150+ miles from his home in Plover, WI to Middleton. Decked out in Donate Life attire and with the help of supporters and the media, he spread his message about the importance of organ donation. But that trip was just a warm-up for his larger plan to ride from Madison to Natchitoches, LA, where he first met Hugh. Mark will depart Madison on Saturday, April 24, accompanied  by his wife Lynn in their support vehicle and anyone who wants to join them to raise awareness and capture the attention of media. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hughsmithmarkscotch\"><u>Read about Mark’s ride</u></a>.</p><p>“People like me, who like to do these things, are always looking for avenues to do these kinds of long rides,” says Mark. “April is Donate Life Month, and the perfect time to combine two things I’m passionate about. Organ donation and biking.” </p><p>Mark’s kidney went to a recipient in New York state, and he’s contemplating a ride there, too. Hugh received his kidney from someone in California and is doing well. “Our kidneys and recipients stretched from the east to west and north to south to cover the entire country!” says Mark.</p><p>Mark is grateful to everyone who helped him learn about living donation. </p><p>“It really helped to hear from other donors who got back to their life, and also how rewarding their donation experience was,” says Mark. “I know my recipient is going to be so thankful for my kidney, and even if they don’t want to meet me, that doesn’t bother me in the least,” says Mark. “There’s no better bang for your buck than being a donor. You can donate your time, talent and treasure, and that’s wonderful, but I don’t know of a single act that is better than this. The benefit and reward are incomparable.”</p><p>He is also grateful for his UW Health team. “They were excellent,” says Mark. “<span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6906</span> was my surgeon and a great help, and everyone was very supportive and thorough.”</p><p>Mark’s life-saving decision, and his work to spread the word about living donation is inspirational. Especially to his wife Lynn, who is being evaluated to be a living kidney donor at UW Health, too.</p>",

But I was able to go to the cranberry festival in Warren and walk around all day and never get tired. I feel terrific and what the doctors have done for me is just amazing.”</p><p>The transplant marks a new era for treating severe forms of scleroderma, a name that literally means &quot;hard skin.” While more mild and common forms of the disease result in hardened patches of skin, severe diffuse scleroderma can cause deadly hardening of the internal organs, including the lungs and the kidneys.</p><p>Beschta&#39;s rheumatologist, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6858</span> says that statistics show that less than half the patients with this form of the disease are alive after 10 years. After a 2018 New England Journal of Medicine <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1703327\">study</a> showed that bone marrow transplant (BMT) significantly improved survival for these patients, he lobbied to bring the treatment to Madison, where BMT has been used for decades to treat various blood cancers.</p><blockquote><p>I feel terrific and what the doctors have done for me is just amazing.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;What was really amazing about this study, was that people started feeling better quicker than anyone expected,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a life-saving procedure for a lot of people. Once it came out, I knew we had an excellent BMT team here and thought that we should offer it.”</p><p>In April, Beschta came to University Hospital in Madison for a procedure normally done for people fighting cancer. Beschta lives in Bonduel, in Shawano County between Green Bay and Wausau.</p><p>Beschta, 55, started getting sick in summer 2017. He was first misdiagnosed with another chronic lung disease, but actually has the worst type of <a href=\"https://www.scleroderma.org/site/SPageNavigator/patients_whatis.html;jsessionid=00000000.app30119b?NONCE_TOKEN=0FCC55D566AE9BCF5A99CBA1098A4D9F#.XMHr4WhKiUk\">scleroderma</a> - called diffuse scleroderma - and it began attacking his organs. He had to have surgery because his esophagus was so scarred he couldn&#39;t swallow his food, and he had to quit singing in his church choir because he couldn&#39;t get a full breath. He was hospitalized frequently, and mycophenolate, the only drug for his condition, stopped being effective. Without transplant, only about half the people with this severe form of the disease are alive after 10 years.</p><p>His team - consisting of specialists in bone marrow transplant, pulmonology and rheumatology - suggested trying the newly approved procedure.</p><p>First, stem cells are removed from the patient&#39;s bone marrow. The University Hospital stem cell laboratory uses a special process to purify the cells to remove all the T-cells including those that are attacking the body and causing scleroderma.</p><p>Next Beschta had chemotherapy and radiation to kill off his old immune system and then his team gave him an infusion of the purified stem cells. Physicians infuse the pure stem cells without the abnormal T-cells that cause scleroderma and essentially &#39;reboot&#39; the immune system so that new T-cells are formed, while eliminating the ones that caused the diease.</p><p>Beschta says he began feeling better almost immediately, while he was still in the hospital following his transplant in early April. Although he&#39;s had a setback of pneumonia this summer, his tests show that his pulmonary function is improving.</p><p>Beschta&#39;s transplant was the first in Wisconsin that was not part of the earlier clinical trial. The team at University Hospital is planning a transplant on a second scleroderma patient soon.</p>",

Both of UW Carbone&#39;s Madison chemotherapy clinics offer a cooling cap system for use during chemotherapy. The caps contain circulating refrigerant, which chills the scalp, closing the blood vessels and preventing the drugs from getting into the hair follicles.</p><p>&quot;It has been such a blessing to me,&quot; Schmidt says. &quot;It was so hard for my sisters to lose their hair. And growing it back out is no fun, either.&quot;</p><p>Schmidt paid $2,200 for caps to wear during her 12 rounds of chemotherapy (the cooling caps vendor, Paxman, works with a non-profit called Hair-to-Stay that provides financial assistance for low income patients). She says the cold is &quot;very tolerable&quot; and she coped by cuddling in a warm blanket. She used the caps for a half hour before and an hour after the infusion, to reduce the damage to the hair follicles.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d recommend it to everyone. I lost my eyebrows, my eyelashes and all the hair on my body,&quot; she says. But her long blonde hair stayed right where it was. &quot;I&#39;m beyond grateful; you wear your hair everywhere.&quot;</p><p>The benefits were many. Keeping her hair meant keeping her privacy. The family owns a manufacturing business, and she and her husband, Rick, frequently entertain international customers. Looking healthy meant not having to discuss her treatment with everyone.</p><p>She even had an amusing moment when she was at the clinic for chemo. A friend who was bald from her own chemotherapy was with her and the nurses were startled that Schmidt, and not her friend, was the patient.</p><p>Looking normal made her children less frightened than they may have been (and sometimes she had to remind them, &quot;Hey, mom<i> is</i> sick, can you pitch in a little?&quot;). The family was also dealing with another serious health issue during her treatment: her grandson was born with a major heart defect that eventually required a transplant.</p><p>&quot;You go through so many emotions with cancer, so much anger and feeling so sick,&#39;&#39; she says, adding that she knows that for other women, hair is the least of their concerns as they go through treatment.</p><p>But for Schmidt, keeping her hair gave her a boost and helped her feel more normal.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and see that I still had my hair,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;d feel like: &#39;I&#39;ve got this.

      "story": "<p>Sandy Malay has never been a “sitter.” So, when the 59-year-old considered the prospect of lying in a hospital bed for up to a year while she waited for the gift of life with a heart transplant, she was not happy with the idea. </p><p>Yet, that was the decision she faced in summer 2020 when she learned her heart disease had gotten worse. She had already been on the wait list at her transplant center for two years and didn’t know how much longer she could continue to wait. So, she followed the advice of her brother, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 5Z6O4zHtvZGLnI5u5Ssv0s</span>, and looked into the possibility of being listed at a second transplant center—the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 14085</span> in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks of being placed on the wait list at UW Health, Sandy received the call she had been awaiting. On September 7, 2020, she underwent surgery to transplant a new heart into her body. “I’m just so lucky,” she says.</p><h2>\r\r\nA family affair</h2><p>\rSandy and three of her five siblings all have the gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. They all were tested in the early 1990s after a cousin learned she had the gene. But Sandy, who was in her 20s at the time, already knew she had heart disease and was under a doctor’s care. Over the years, she did fairly well and didn’t start taking medications until 2006. She received a defibrillator in 2011, and gradually, her fatigue started to decrease her quality of life. Sandy was working long hours and traveling each week as a regional manager for Kwik Trip and couldn’t keep up with the hectic pace of her life, so she stepped down to a different position in 2018. “I was really, really tired,” she says. “My heart just could not keep up with the hours and traveling.”\r\n\r\nBy 2018, Sandy’s doctors at the other transplant center put her on the wait list for a heart transplant, but they warned her she might be waiting several years. In the meantime, Sandy’s brother Mark moved quickly through the transplant process: He was put on the wait list for a heart at UW Health in March 2020, and by May, he received the gift of life. He recommended that she pursue dual listing, which means being listed at two different hospitals simultaneously. After Sandy’s heart disease became worse in summer 2020, she agreed and began talking to staff at UW Health. Sandy went on the list in August 2020 and received her new heart in September. \r\n\r\nWhy was Sandy’s wait in Madison so much shorter than her wait at the other center? UW Health is one of just a few transplant centers involved in a trial study on the use of donation after circulatory death (DCD) hearts. As part of the process, organs are retrieved from a patient after his or her heart stops. Health care professionals then perfuse the heart in warm blood and are able to assess the organ’s viability, essentially “reanimating” it for use in another person. The study has the potential of radically increasing the number of donor hearts that are available and saving more lives.\r\n\r\nSandy was thrilled she was able to receive a second chance at life with her new heart. “I’m going to take care of this heart as if it were my child,” she says. “I call it ‘Miracle.’ When I’m going through cardiac rehabilitation, I will talk to it, encouraging it to keep on going.”\r\n\r\nWhile her other two siblings with the gene have not yet reached the point of being listed for a heart transplant, they have switched their care to Madison and are now seeing <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6437</span>, cardiologist at UW Health and the same doctor who treats Sandy and Mark.\r\n\r\n“I feel very comfortable with the team at the UW Health Heart Transplant Program,” says Sandy. “The doctors and nurses very much care about you and listen to anything you have to say.”\r \r\n\r</p>",

A spot on the baby&#39;s bowel was found, which ultimately was identified as an intestinal blockage – something that can be very serious.\r</p><p>Fortunately, duodenal atresia – the type of blockage found on the scan – is usually treatable with surgery immediately after birth. Still, this unexpected news, combined with a separate finding of a hole in the baby&#39;s heart, left a large cloud over the rest of the pregnancy for Beth and her husband, who live in central Wisconsin.</p><p>On one hand, getting this information a few months before their baby was due gave mom and dad plenty of time to plan for the emotionally rocky road that lay ahead. On the other, there were lots of unanswered questions that would have to wait for answers until birth. Moreover, knowing that their baby would be taken to surgery so soon after entering the world left them anxious at a time when most expectant couples get to revel in the excitement of a new baby.\r</p><p>The intestinal blockage left open the possibility for other complications that might not be known until birth. Knowing that she had to have bowel surgery right away added to the stress.\r</p><h3>Birth and surgery scheduled in Madison\r</h3><p>Plans were made for Beth to deliver in Madison rather than at home because of the need to be close to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L169</span>, where the surgery would be done. In cases like this, the mother delivers at UnityPoint Health – Meriter, home of the UW Health Maternal Fetal Medicine team as well as a Level III neonatal intensive care unit for newborns needing acute care.</p><p>As Beth&#39;s pregnancy continued, so did the complications. By week 30, Beth&#39;s baby was diagnosed with an abnormal arrangement of heart veins. Ultimately, this condition would be diagnosed as heterotaxy – a rare birth defect signified by an abnormal arrangement of internal organs in the chest and abdomen. Fortunately, this abnormality did not affect the baby&#39;s biological function or cognitive development.\r</p><p>After several weeks of nervous anticipation, Beth delivered her beautiful baby girl – named Ivy – on a late night in August 2016. \r</p><p>&quot;I got to hold Ivy right away, but I knew it would only be a day or two before she would have surgery. I did everything I could to avoid an epidural so I would be physically capable of riding along with her in the Med Flight ambulance to American Family Children&#39;s Hospital.”\r</p><p>About 36 hours after birth, Ivy was taken to the operating room, where UW Health pediatric surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8229</span>, MD – considered a national expert on duodenal atresia – repaired Ivy&#39;s intestinal blockage.\r</p><h3>Surgeon was confident and assuring</h3><p>&quot;Dr. Nichol was very confident, which I appreciated because all of my hopes and fears were tied up in what he was about to do to my baby,” Beth said.\r</p><p>A few hours later, Dr. Nichol walked into Ivy&#39;s hospital room in the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C1019</span> (NICU). Everything went just fine, he assured Beth, much to her incredible relief.\r</p><p>&quot;He was very nonchalant, as if it&#39;s all in a day&#39;s work,” Beth said. &quot;Even though it was hardly routine for me, I felt much better knowing it all seemed routine for him.”\r</p><p>Recovery from duodenal atresia surgery typically includes a two-week stay in the hospital.\r</p><p>&quot;Getting babies to feed safely and start gaining weight can be tricky after bowel surgery,” said UW Health lactation consultant Barb Fibich. &quot;In Ivy&#39;s case, she started with intravenous feeding, followed by tube feeding into the small intestine. Once she began to gain weight, our team, which includes experts in lactation and speech pathology, helped Beth begin breast feeding.”\r</p><h3>Spleen abnormality also discovered</h3><p>As if Ivy didn&#39;t have enough challenges, one more anomaly was discovered around her 10th day of life. Instead of a single normal-sized spleen, which most of us have to filter our blood to help fight infection, Ivy was found to have a chain of mini-spleens in her belly – a condition called polysplenia.</p><p>&quot;Without a single normal spleen, Ivy&#39;s ability to fight infection was compromised, although we have no way of knowing by how much,” said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10616</span>, a UW Health infectious disease specialist. &quot;Accordingly, we put Ivy on penicillin to boost her immunity. In time, we will revisit this course of treatment but for now, we consider this a very low-risk approach for treating her polysplenia.”\r</p><p>Aside from occasional check-ups with Dr. McBride and the Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic, Ivy has done great over the four years since recovering from surgery. Her family is incredibly grateful for the care they received at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital. At the same time, they deserve plenty of credit for being so highly engaged with her daughter&#39;s situation and Ivy&#39;s medical team in Madison. </p><p>&quot;Ivy&#39;s family was very hungry for information to be sure they would do right by their baby,” said Dr. McBride. &quot;I was confident Ivy would do well in their hands.”\r</p><p>Now 4, Ivy was scheduled to start 4K in fall 2020, but her parents deferred school for a year because of COVID-19, something that Ivy refers to as &quot;the sickness.”\r</p><p>Ivy&#39;s interests run the gamut from LEGOs to art projects to reading to cats and pigs. She enjoys cooking and baking with her mom and also loves looking at pictures and hearing stories of her time in the hospital – so much so that she wants to be a surgeon when she grows up.\r</p><p>&quot;When she turned 4, she asked for the Smithsonian human body encyclopedia,” said Beth. &quot;She loves X-rays, bones and learning about all the body systems. And when she pretends to &#39;operate&#39; on her stuffed animals at home, she often assumes the role of Dr. Nichol.”</p><p>When asked what stands out about her daughter&#39;s care at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital, Beth can&#39;t say enough.\r</p><p>&quot;They took care of my baby, but they also took the time to take care of me too,” Beth said. &quot;I remember so many people during our time in the hospital who will always hold a dear place in my heart.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Chue Yang’s health took a nosedive when the Madison, Wisconsin man suffered a stroke that paralyzed part of his arm and leg. He learned that the stroke was a result of uncontrolled diabetes, which was also causing his kidneys to fail. His doctors told him his kidneys were functioning at only 5 percent and he needed to go on dialysis.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Chue was placed on the wait list at UW Health for a combined kidney-pancreas transplant. His doctors told him that because he suffered from diabetes, receiving both organs in a transplant would not only help his kidney function, but it would also eliminate the need for insulin. Chue was at a dialysis center when he received a call that a kidney and pancreas had become available for him. He rushed to the hospital and received the gift of life with a transplant. “I was really glad they chose me,” he says. “Otherwise, I would still be on dialysis. They took really good care of me at University Hospital.”\r\n\r\nAfter the transplant, Chue’s wife, Xia, stayed in the hospital with him for a week with their newborn son. When they returned home, Chue discovered he was in better health than he had been for years. From habit, he still checks his blood sugar every day, and it’s normal all the time now.\r\n\r\nChue and Xia are Hmong, an ethnic group that is often uncomfortable with organ donation. However, now that Chue has experienced the lifesaving effects of a transplant, he thinks his friends and family are more open to becoming organ donors. The dad of two sons, ages 23 and 2, Chue wants to teach his boys that there are many ways to help other people. “If somebody didn’t donate this kidney to me, I don’t know what would have happened,” he says. “I would be interested in organ donation if something ever happened to me.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Over the course of his 34 years as an American Airlines flight attendant, Doug Greer has paged through the American Way in-flight magazine hundreds of times. He never anticipated that his reading material would inspire him to pursue a life-changing surgery. \r</p><p>Doug, who is now 59, was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 45. Although doctors initially thought he had Type 2 diabetes, he later learned it was Type 1.</p><p>He spent the next 14 years fighting the disease while simultaneously trying to be a single dad to his two boys, now 13 and 14. During that time, the man from Fort Myers, Fla., weathered four or five hospital stays for ketoacidosis and pancreatitis — both serious complications of diabetes.</p><p>&quot;I was just so over it,” he said. &quot;At first, I tried using pills and pens to regulate my blood sugar, but they didn’t work, so I got an insulin pump. I tried to exercise and eat right, and then something would happen.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, Doug was flying home after a trip to Buenos Aires when he saw a magazine advertisement for the UW Health Pancreas Transplant Program in Madison. He had never even heard of a pancreas transplant, so once he was on the ground, he called the program right away. He flew to Wisconsin in March 2020, underwent all the necessary tests and prepared to go on the wait list for a new pancreas. Then, the program went on a brief hiatus as the nation’s hospitals prepared for a surge of coronavirus (COVID-19) patients.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, Doug was activated on the wait list, and just a few weeks later, he received a call that a pancreas had become available. He quickly arranged for childcare for his boys and drove from Florida to Madison in time for his surgery on June 22.</p><p>The last memory he has from before his transplant was when he was in the operating room and the team showed him the organ that was about to be placed inside him. “It was kind of a spiritual moment for me,” he said. “I thought, &#39;Oh my goodness, this is it.&#39; &quot;\r\n\r\nHe recovered in the hospital for a week, then a friend traveled to stay with him in a Madison hotel for two weeks while he received outpatient care at UW Health. Now, he’s back in Fort Myers, savoring the fact that he no longer has diabetes.</p><p>To celebrate, he had ice cream for the first time in 15 years. Doug is able to continue his leave from work, something for which he is grateful because transplant recipients are severely immunocompromised, and he would be exposed to the coronavirus as a flight attendant.\r\n\r\nDoug remains incredibly appreciative for both the family of his organ donor and the staff who cared for him at University Hospital.</p><p>&quot;They made this experience a true, true blessing in my mind and heart,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone is truly concerned and devoted to what they are doing.&quot;\n\r\nNow, he has just one message he’d like to send to anyone who struggles with diabetes and is considering a pancreas transplant: “This is possible. It does work. To me, it’s a true miracle.&quot;</p>",

But when he was diagnosed with kidney disease, Scott found himself in a life-threatening situation that tested his limits.</p><p>What&#39;s more, he had to rely on his wife, Heidi, who gave him the gift of life with her own kidney so he could participate in a kidney exchange. He received his new kidney in April 2016, and since then, has been able to live his life to the fullest.</p><p>Scott first became sick in 2015. As a child, he had one kidney removed due to complications from a birth defect, and when his remaining kidney started developing problems, the only solutions were either dialysis or a transplant. He resisted going on dialysis for a long time because he was in denial about his condition — until his nephrologist finally told Heidi to take him to the emergency room.</p><p>&quot;I spent several months fearing my husband was going to die at any moment,&quot; Heidi said. &quot;Doctors told me he could have had a stroke because he waited so long to go on dialysis.&quot;</p><p>Both Scott&#39;s adult daughter and his sister were willing to donate their kidneys to him, but when they learned they couldn&#39;t donate because of health issues, Heidi stepped up — despite Scott&#39;s protests. While Heidi wasn&#39;t a direct match for her husband, they were able to participate in a paired kidney exchange in which Heidi donated her kidney to a stranger, and that stranger&#39;s loved one gave a kidney to Scott.</p><p>The week before the surgery at University Hospital in Madison, Scott&#39;s surgeon, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8868</span>, MD, asked if he would be willing to participate in a drug trial following his transplant. Belatacept, an anti-rejection medication, had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but UW Health was involved in a trial that would allow patients to substitute belatacept for calcineurin inhibitors and the need for chronic use of steroids.</p><p>Scott agreed, and when his participation in the study ended two years later, he chose to continue belatacept, which requires him to undergo an infusion of medication once a month instead of taking steroids and enduring their side effects.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t even think twice about it because it&#39;s worked so well,&quot; Scott said. &quot;I&#39;ve had no side effects from the medication at all, except for canker sores.&quot;</p><p>Because of the belatacept, Scott is able to live his life without limitations. And because of his faith in God and the Baders&#39; incredibly supportive community and church friends, both he and Heidi have thrived in their personal lives and in work.</p><p>&quot;When I woke up after my transplant and looked out the window, I thanked God for the most beautiful sunrise I&#39;d ever seen,&quot; Scott said. &quot;Now, every morning, I thank God for a beautiful sunrise.

      "story": "<p>Brian Forrest had been thinking a lot about his 62-year-old cousin Richard Gillette, who was suffering from end-stage liver disease.</p><p>&quot;Richard is one of five brothers who I had always looked up to when I was a kid,&quot; said Brian, 48. &quot;When they were young, all five of them came up from Illinois during the summer to help out on my dad&#39;s farm in Stratford,&quot; — a village of 1,600 in northern Wisconsin, about 30 miles west of Wausau.</p><p>Two of the five brothers died in their 50s - and Brian didn&#39;t want to see a third Gillette brother die before his time.</p><p>As sick as Richard was in the spring of 2019, he was unlikely to receive a new liver from a deceased donor in time to save his life. Too many patients were ahead of him on the transplant list - and most of them were even sicker. </p><h3>Brian makes an important call</h3><p>Richard&#39;s brother, Garry, told Brian about a friend of his who got screened to become a living liver donor. (A living donor undergoes surgery in which part, not all, of the liver is removed. Within weeks, the liver grows back in size.)</p><p>&quot;Talking with Garry made me think about becoming a living liver donor for Richard,&quot; said Brian. &quot;At first, I assumed it was unlikely that my liver would be a match for Richard. Still, I was curious enough to look into it.&quot;</p><p>Knowing that Richard was being cared for by the UW Health Transplant Team in Madison, Brian spoke with Transplant Coordinator Beth Spaith the next morning.</p><p>&quot;I knew my blood type matched Richard&#39;s, so Beth explained everything I would have to go through just to determine if I could be a donor,&quot; Brian said. &quot;It was a little daunting.&quot;</p><p>To learn if he would qualify as Richard&#39;s liver donor, Brian would have to undergo three days of extensive screening in Madison. The outcome was out of his hands, but Brian found some comfort in that.</p><p>&quot;My wife, Elaine, and I kept saying that God was driving the car and we were just riding in the back seat waiting to see where it would go,&quot; Brian said.</p><p>Also available to Brian — and to anyone considering becoming a living donor — are UW Health social workers, who go over every facet of the process and stay engaged with living donors throughout their journey.</p><p>&quot;While there is no medical benefit to becoming a living donor — and there clearly are risks — the emotional payoff of supporting a loved one or friend this way can be incredibly high,&quot; said UW Health Transplant social worker Paul Smith. </p><h3>Total support from family</h3><p>Brian made a point of involving his entire family as he weighed the pluses and minuses of donating part of his liver. If he was a match, Brian would undergo a complex surgery followed by six to 12 weeks of recuperation that would greatly impact Elaine, their five children, and the employees of his family-run dairy farm. He would not move forward without everyone&#39;s buy-in, which he received in full.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people would have to pick up the slack for me. It took a village, and we were very lucky to have a village,&quot; Brian said. Following the screening process, Brian passed every test and the transplant surgery was scheduled.</p><p>With three surgeons required, along with two comprehensive medical staffs — one for the donor and one for the recipient — scheduling a transplant surgery can take up to a few months to coordinate. Fortunately, everything fell into place for a July 1, 2019, surgery, a mere six weeks after Brian first thought about becoming a living donor. </p><h3>Would &#39;do it again in a heartbeat&#39;</h3><p>Everything went well and today, Brian is fully recovered. Richard is back home in Rockford, Ill., with a new lease on life, thanks to his generous cousin.</p><p>&quot;I would do it again in a heartbeat,&quot; Brian said. &quot;For someone considering it, this is not something to take lightly. The first week after surgery was kind of tough, but by Week 5, I was just about back to normal. It&#39;s also amazing how quickly both my liver and Richard&#39;s grew back in just a few weeks. Most of all, this whole experience brought our family even closer. It&#39;s hard to put a price on that.&quot;</p>",

Merry was afraid to sleep alone because she suffered from hypoglycemia unawareness, a complication of diabetes in which the patient is unaware of a deep drop in blood sugar. \r\n\r\nFor more than five decades, Merry, who lives in Phlox, Wis., struggled to control her diabetes. Then, she learned she qualified for a pancreas transplant at the UW Health Pancreas Transplant Program in Madison.</p><p>It was a long road from diabetes patient to transplant recipient, but now she’s healthy, happy and thrilled she doesn’t have to give herself shots anymore.\r</p><p>Merry first received her diabetes diagnosis at age 4 and spent her 5th birthday (which was also Christmas Day) in the hospital. As she grew older, she didn’t play sports because exercising caused her blood sugar to drop, and sleepovers at friends’ houses were extra stressful for her parents.

      "image": "/content/images/4mMd0tIvIDhk3VKmHtg0QG.jpg",
      "story": "<p>Lisa Steinkamp has a simple message for people – especially active people like herself – about getting a knee replacement.</p><p>“Don’t put up with the pain and lack of function,” says Dr. Steinkamp, who directs the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. “Get the new knee and enjoy more of the activities you have been missing out on.”</p><p>\rUntil about 20 years ago, the “conventional wisdom” regarding knee replacements was to live with discomfort as long as possible because an artificial knee would only last 10 to 15 years. Then it will be time for another replacement.</p><p>While this line of thinking may have been sound years ago, there is much better news for today’s patients.</p><p>“Contemporary artificial knees are significantly more durable,” says Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10918</span>, a UW Health orthopedic knee-and-hip surgeon who performed Lisa’s knee replacement in late 2020. “The plastic and biomaterials are significantly better than they were 20 years ago, which means the artificial joint lasts much longer and the incidence of failure today is a fraction of what it has been historically.”</p><p>Lisa was 61 when she decided to pursue surgery and her story was familiar. Several years of playing soccer in college led to tearing both menisci, nature’s shock absorbers, in her left knee. At just 19, she underwent surgery to remove the menisci – not just the torn segments – because that was standard practice at the time. Unfortunately, this left Lisa with a bone-on-bone knee by the time she finished school. She gave up running, tennis and other high-impact sports, but still maintained a heavy regimen of cycling, hiking, skiing, water skiing, golf and weight-lifting. </p><p>Like driving a car with balding tires, a substandard knee like Lisa’s can only take so much wear and tear. By the time she was in her 40s, engaging in her favorite activities invariably resulted in painful swelling followed by several days of “paying the price.”</p><p>“I’d ski or hike for an hour and it would get super swollen,” Lisa says. “Then I’d battle through and end up hobbling around for a few days. It wasn’t pleasant, but I still thought of surgery as a last resort.”</p><h3>Dr. Nickel told Lisa her life could improve greatly with surgery</h3><p>Finally in 2020, the situation worsened enough to merit a visit with an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Nickel, a fellowship trained knee-and-hip specialist who performs more than 700 joint replacements annually, told Lisa that she didn’t have to go on suffering. </p><p>“We discussed the reality that she didn’t have to give up the things she enjoyed,” Nickel says. “Lisa also was an excellent candidate for outpatient surgery, which meant she could be walking about two hours after surgery is completed and on her way home a few hours after that.”</p><p>While it’s not for everyone, same-day joint-replacement surgery at UW Health has become increasingly popular, especially for younger, more active patients and those who have a good caregiver at home.</p><p>“We work with the patient to determine whether same-day surgery or an overnight stay is best for them,” says Nickel. Moreover, he adds, most knee/hip replacement patients receive regional (spinal) anesthesia with gentle sedation, which is safer than general anesthesia. </p><p>“It doesn’t take as long for patients to wake up and recover, yet they still have no memory of anything during the operation,” Nickel says. “Why didn’t I have surgery sooner?”</p><p>Nickel tells his patients that the first two weeks after surgery are the toughest, and Lisa doesn’t disagree. By a month out, however, she was feeling great. She was hiking at eight weeks, snowshoeing at 10 weeks and skiing as hard as she has at 12 weeks. </p><p>“These felt like monumental achievements,” Lisa says. “Of course I was asking myself why I didn’t have the surgery several years earlier.” As a physical therapist, Lisa also reminds prospective patients that they are likely to come out of surgery stronger if they go into surgery stronger – just one more benefit to having surgery at a younger age.</p><p>Regardless of whether the patient’s primary goal is greater function, like Lisa, or pain relief from an arthritic knee, Nickel and his UW Health orthopedic colleagues can help on both counts. </p><p>“With today’s artificial knees being made better and lasting longer, many patients can have a replacement in their 50s or 60s with little chance of needing a revision or redo surgery,” says Nickel. “We also encourage patients to consider a center like UW Health, where joint replacement surgeons perform only hip and knee replacements and accumulate high volumes of first-time replacement patients. Our team,” Nickel adds, “also has great experience performing complex revision surgeries on patients who are referred from greater distances. As part of a tertiary academic center, our team offers a skill set that is second-to-none regionally and  recently ranked as the #15 orthopedic hospital in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Sally Casey vividly remembers the last day she talked to her daughter, Charity.</p><p>It was April 2, 2021, and Sally was up at her cabin in Danbury, Wisconsin, when she spoke on the phone to Charity, who was at their home in New Richmond, Wisconsin. Charity and her boyfriend, Carl, were planning to take a long motorcycle ride, but Charity was having second thoughts because it was so chilly.\r\n\r\nShe and Carl headed out on their ride anyway, each of them on their own motorcycle. After they dropped Charity’s bike off at a friend’s house, she hopped on Carl’s bike with him. As the two were rounding an S-curve, Carl’s back tire blew, the bike went into a slide, and they crashed. Charity suffered a bad head injury. She wasn’t wearing a helmet.\r\n\r\nShe was rushed to the closest hospital and then airlifted to a larger trauma center in LaCrosse Wisconsin. In the meantime, Sally frantically found someone to watch her puppy and arrived at the hospital at 4 a.m. “I couldn’t talk to her or touch her,” she says. “She was supposed to have no stimulation.”\r\n\r\nFor the next week, Sally and Carl kept vigil while doctors tried everything possible to heal Charity’s brain injury. Eventually, however, they knew Charity would not recover. She had registered to be an organ donor, so the doctors waited to remove life support until they had found recipients for all of Charity’s organs.\r\n\r\nSally, whose son had died five years ago after a motorcycle accident and eight days connected to life support, knew what to expect. “I knew with that bad of a brain injury, it wasn’t good,” she says. “But it was still incredibly hard.”\r\n\r\nAfter Charity became an organ donor hero, Sally went home to grieve and remember her daughter, whom she says was outgoing, stubborn and very independent. Charity insisted on performing all the maintenance and repairs for her car and motorcycle and she loved garden gnomes and going on motorcycle rides with friends. Charity had a 29-year-old daughter named Abby, and for the last 15 years, Charity lived with her mother. “She was my best friend,” says Sally.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after losing her daughter, Sally started to experience the silver lining of having a child who was an organ donor. She began receiving letters from Charity’s recipients, including two men who each received one of Charity’s kidneys, and a woman who received Charity’s heart. But the most fulfilling communication has been with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 3jlPQ7cAdFbVWOKXUkmvZL</span>, who received Charity’s pancreas.\r\n\r\nPat, who lives in Appleton, Wisconsin, struggled with diabetes for 25 years. Now that he has a healthy pancreas, he is cured. After exchanging texts for a while, Sally met Pat and his family while she was traveling with friends to a Green Bay Packers game. “He was telling me how awesome he feels,” she says. “It’s like I have a new family.”\r\n\r\nSally misses Charity every day. But, although she cries when she reads them, she has continued receiving letters from the recipients, and so grateful Charity made the choice to be an organ donor. \r</p>",

      "story": "<p>For 25 years, Pat Orioles struggled with a disease that seemed tailor-made to thwart him. </p><p>The Appleton, Wisconsin, man has always loved food—particularly sweets. When he learned at age 30 that he had Type 1 diabetes, he was in shock.</p><p>“I remember just sitting there, crying, thinking this couldn’t be happening to me,” he says. “I was active and healthy.”</p><p>That moment began a long journey through oral medications, insulin injections and, eventually, an insulin pump. While Pat exercised regularly, he didn’t always stick to the strict diet required of people who live with Type 1 diabetes. “You really don’t realize when you’re mismanaging the disease,” he says. “It’s insidious. The problems don’t manifest themselves until later in your life, and by then it’s basically destroying your internal organs.”</p><p>Pat’s life has definitely been busy. He and his wife Danielle had two young boys (now 17 and 15), and throughout his career as a global buyer, he has traveled around the world and managed large teams for his companies. But he tried his best to keep his disease a secret, maintaining the façade that everything was fine. In 2017, when the physician assistant in his endocrinologist’s office suggested he might benefit from a pancreas transplant, he balked at the idea and was more determined than ever to continue using his insulin pump.</p><p>Then, in March 2020, he was on a video call with his team at a new job when a young co-worker mentioned she “used” to have diabetes. After their meeting, she talked with him for hours about how a pancreas transplant helped her reclaim her life. “That conversation changed everything for me,” he said.</p><p>His co-worker gave him the name of Nancy Radke, a pancreas transplant coordinator at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. Pat connected with Nancy and started the process of testing to determine if he qualified for a transplant. He got on the wait list in April 2021, and it was none too soon—right before that, he had a scary low blood sugar episode on a bike ride in Utah that could have rendered him unconscious.</p><p>In the meantime, 47-year-old <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 7chK27M94oU3opBth2UsQP</span> of New Richmond, Wisconsin, was fighting for her life after a motorcycle crash on April 2. Doctors in LaCrosse were desperately trying to save her, but after a week, they told her mother, Sally, and boyfriend she wouldn’t recover. Charity was registered as an organ donor, so organ donation staff members began the process of matching her organs to people who needed them. Pat was one of those people. </p><p>He received the gift of life with a new pancreas on April 14, 2021. “When I woke up,” he says, “even feeling as badly as I did from the surgery, I knew I was healed from my diabetes.”</p><p>After a week, he returned home, still hardly able to believe that he didn’t need insulin anymore. He wrote Sally a letter thanking her for Charity’s heroic gift, and the two eventually exchanged phone numbers and started connecting with each other on a regular basis.</p><p>Sally and some friends were headed to a Green Bay Packers game in January 2022, so they stopped and met with Pat and Danielle on the way. The meeting went well, and they have continued their relationship. “It’s like I have a new family,” says Sally.</p><p>Pat says he feels like he is the healthiest he has been in 13 years. “This is transformative—to go from an insulin-dependent diabetic for 25 years to being healed,” he says. “Now, whenever I meet people who have diabetes, I tell them they have to get a pancreas transplant.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>When Sophia Moore was hospitalized for debilitating stomach problems two years ago, a medical resident asked her mother, Melinda, what her goal was for her daughter.</p><p>“I told her I wanted Sophia to have a livable life,” says Melinda.</p><p>Now, after undergoing a renal autotransplant at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, Sophia, now 19, is feeling much better and is hopeful for a bright future.</p><p>Sophia first started inexplicably vomiting in 2017. Her parents took her to a long list of specialists and tried many different types of therapies, including medication, physical therapy and chiropractic healing. By May 2018, she had vomited so much her ribs were thrown out of place, and doctors had to remove three ribs so she could breathe more easily. </p><p>Despite many, many different rounds of medications, the cycle continued. Sophia and her parents grew frustrated with caregivers’ assessment of the situation. “People called her anorexic and bulimic,” says Melinda. “They were very condescending. They couldn’t figure it out, so they assumed it must all be in her head.”</p><p>As Sophia’s situation grew worse, her parents were more and more concerned. In September 2019, she started throwing up and never stopped, often vomiting up to 50 times a day. In September 2020, she had a permanent feeding tube placed.</p><p>“They basically told me my stomach had stopped working,” says Sophia. “They told me I had motility problems, but none of the motility medications were working for me.”</p><p>At one of the hospitals Sophia visited, a doctor suggested she might have median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), a condition in which a band of tissue in the chest presses on an artery that supplies blood to the upper organs. They reached out to a MALS specialist in Connecticut, and Sophia had a successful surgery in April 2021 that relieved the compression and allowed her to eat again.</p><p>In September 2021, however, Sophia’s nausea and vomiting came back full force, and she started experiencing pain in her left side. Through social media groups, the Moores knew MALS was often linked to nutcracker syndrome, a vein compression disorder. They learned about the UW Health Renal Autotransplant Program, which helped people with nutcracker syndrome and other compression disorders, and they traveled from their home in eastern Minnesota to Madison for testing in February 2022.</p><p>Staff at UW Health performed a venogram—an X-ray test in which they injected dye into her veins to show how blood flowed through them. Sure enough, Sophia’s vein compression was so severe that her body had created additional veins just so her blood would have somewhere to go. Her blood could flow into her kidney, but it couldn’t easily flow back out, which was causing stress on her kidney.</p><p>On March 9, 2022, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080</span>, transplant surgeon and medical director of the renal autotransplant program, performed surgery on Sophia. He removed her left kidney and ureter, cleaned up the kidney and put it back in her right pelvic area.</p><p>The procedure worked. “Right out of surgery, I felt literally no pain on my left side,” says Sophia. “I only had surgical pain. I immediately felt so much less nauseous.”</p><p>The next month, doctors were able to take Sophia’s feeding tube out, and though she had a limited diet at first, she was finally eating food again. This summer, she hopes to return to classes at the University of Minnesota Rochester, where she had started college in fall 2021 before needing to take a medical leave.</p><p>“I’m relieved,” says Melinda. “This has been so long, and it’s been hard to watch. It was really nice to find people who actually understood this problem.”</p><p> </p>",

      "story": "<p>Few of us ever experience facial paralysis. Thankfully, many of those who do return to normal within a few weeks or months. A small number, however, never truly recover.</p><p>Most of us never worry about the process of smiling or talking. Imagine, however, if the muscles in your face became “re-wired” to work very differently. Think about trying to smile or speak, only to have one of your eyes close instead. Or maybe one side of your mouth can’t hold food in anymore. Then think about how total strangers often make split-second judgments based on our facial appearance. </p><p>Renee Hacker of Rockton, Illinois is among a small niche of people to experience severe facial paralysis, but thanks to UW Health’s Facial Nerve Clinic, she enjoys a much higher quality of life today than when her symptoms first surfaced in early 2020.</p><p>A few weeks after recovering from a nasty viral infection (probably COVID-19 before it became widely identified), Renee and her husband Jerry drove to Fort Myers Beach, Florida for a monthlong winter vacation.</p><div></div><p>While sipping a cocktail, Renee suddenly discovered that she couldn’t close her mouth around the straw. Her tongue felt “fat” and her mouth was dry. As the day progressed, her mouth and right side of her face slowly drooped. </p><p>“My husband thought I was having a stroke,” Renee says. “We went to a walk-in clinic, and I was grateful that it was not a stroke. They diagnosed me with Bell’s palsy, something I was familiar with from years of working as an assistant in an oral surgeon’s office.” </p><p>An unexplained weakness that leads to visible changes on one side of the face, Bell’s palsy occurs as a result of damage to the facial nerve. About 40,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with it each year. </p><p>Bell’s palsy not only affects the face’s physical appearance, but also reduces muscle control, taste and tear flow. In Renee’s case, she could not keep chewed food or beverages from falling out of the right side of her mouth. She also became extremely sensitive to noise and suffered persistent headaches. </p><p>While she tried to enjoy her time in Florida, each day began with her own pity party.</p><p>“I never cussed so much in my life, but once I vented to myself in the morning, I was usually better the rest of the day,” she says. </p><h2>She hoped it would resolve naturally</h2><p>Renee also took comfort knowing that 80 to 90 percent of people with Bell’s Palsy completely recover on their own within a few weeks to three months. </p><p>Unfortunately, Renee was one of the unlucky few whose case did not resolve on its own. She felt lost and alone, affected just as much emotionally as she was physically. Three months went by before she went online and discovered UW Health’s Facial Nerve Clinic. </p><p>It took a few more months before Renee was finally diagnosed with synkinesis, a permanent condition characterized by an unwanted over-correction of the facial nerve in its attempt to recover from Bell’s palsy. </p><p>“Renee’s facial nerve came back to life, but not in the normal way it does for most people with Bell’s palsy,” says UW Health plastic &amp; facial reconstructive surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9437</span>. “The synkinesis caused her facial nerve to over-recover, which messed up the coordination of Renee’s facial movements. Bell’s palsy also weakened her forehead muscle, causing her eyebrow to droop to the point where it interfered with her ability to drive or read.”</p><p>While there are only a smattering of facial nerve clinics across the country who can help patients like Renee, she considered herself lucky to find one less than an hour from her northern Illinois home — the UW Health Facial Nerve Clinic in Madison.</p><p>“From my first appointment, I was so impressed with how well coordinated everything was,” Renee says. “It’s a very thorough team-based approach with a surgeon, physical therapist and nurse who sat down together and got to know me and my situation. I didn’t have to repeat my story and describe my symptoms again and again.”</p><h2>Treatment included surgery, Botox® and physical therapy</h2><p>UW Health helped Renee find hope. The three major components of her treatment included:</p><p>Surgery performed by Dr. Chaiet to lift her eyebrow back to its natural position and remove some excess skin from her upper eyelid that was obstructing her vision; </p><p>Periodic Botox® injections given by Dr. Chaiet that help relax Renee’s overactive facial muscles; and</p><p>Ongoing physical therapy led by UW Health’s Jodi Janczewski, one of only a few specialist facial nerve therapists in Wisconsin properly trained to help patients with facial nerve abnormalities.</p><p>“We are incredibly lucky to have someone like Jodi here because very few therapists have the training to do what she does,” says Dr. Chaiet. “Jodi was trained by Jackie Diels, a true pioneer in the field who is now in private practice after 31 years with UW Health.”</p><p>Patients like Renee start physical therapy with two treatment objectives in mind.</p><p>“First, we want to train the patient how to return their face to a normal resting state,” Jodi says. “Once we get there, the second goal is to teach Renee how her face has been improperly re-wired so she can learn what she needs to do to make a more normal-looking smile or pucker of her lips. It takes a lot of work both in clinic and at home, and I often tell patients it’s like learning to play a musical instrument. They’re not going to be ready to go out on tour without practice and plenty of time to perfect their skills.”</p><h2>Improvement in all areas</h2><p>Jodi takes pictures of her patients at each session, which helps keep people like Renee motivated to do the work. It has paid off cosmetically, functionally and emotionally. </p><p>“I will continue with the Botox® injections every 12 weeks,” Renee says. “I’m hoping to stop coming for physical therapy by the end of 2022 and do what I need to do exclusively at home. Jodi says I am on track, which is very encouraging.”</p><p>While Renee would never wish her diagnosis on anyone, she has come to terms with it and hopes others who are suffering in silence know there is reason for hope.</p><p>“I know there are people out there who are afraid to leave home because of their facial appearance,” Renee says. “They deserve the kind of help I received so they can feel better mentally and physically.”</p><p>Renee has learned so much, and not just about the facial muscle exercises that have become part of her everyday routine. </p><p>“Strangers may always make split-second judgements based on appearances, but I no longer worry about my asymmetrical face,” Renee says. “I have shared my story on Facebook, complete with all the unflattering photos. If this helps someone else muster up more resilience and courage, that’s a good thing.”</p><p>Looking back, Renee is grateful to UW Health not only for her facial  improvements but also a more peaceful state of mind. </p><p>“This journey boosted my self-confidence, and I now know that real beauty comes from the inside,” Renee says. “The last two years also taught me the value of patience, which I have struggled with my entire life. Now I have no choice because I will need daily PT forever and plan to continue with facial muscle-relaxing injections every 12 weeks. I’m truly blessed to have family, friends, and a health care team that have never let me feel like anything other than ‘me.’”</p>",

      "story": "<p>As a teenager and young adult with cystic fibrosis (CF), Paul Langenecker was able to keep himself relatively healthy through occasional “tune-ups,” typically two-week stays in the hospital where he received large doses of antibiotics. </p><p>Paul was fortunate to have teachers and bosses who understood his unique health needs and supported him or gave him the time off that he needed. After high school, Paul went to technical college to become an electrician, attending classes at night and working during the day. By that point, he needed &quot;tune-ups&quot; three times a year, usually about six weeks off, but he still had enough support in his life to make it work. \r\n\r\nBy the time he was 25, Paul’s disease caught up with him. He got married in September 2018, and during his honeymoon at Wisconsin Dells, his medication port became infected. He was in the hospital for a month and had to stop working because he could barely walk. The following July, Paul — who lives in Mayville, Wis. — was added to the lung transplant wait list at a Milwaukee hospital.\r\n\r\n“I was never down in the dumps,” he said. “I’ve always been a very positive person. I just felt bad for my wife, Amy, because she had to do everything for me.”\r\n\r\nPaul already had started investigating dual listing (being placed on the wait list at more than one hospital) at UW Health in Madison when he learned the lung transplant program at the Milwaukee hospital had closed. He joined the wait list at UW Health in late September, and not a moment too soon — he became very ill and had to be hospitalized at University Hospital in October. On Oct. 29, he received the gift of life with new lungs.</p><p>“When you take your first breath by yourself, it’s so awesome,” he said.\n\r\nWhile Paul, 27, continues to recover from his surgery, he&#39;s thrilled by the opportunity to plan for the future.

He also likes to golf and looks forward to hitting the greens again.</p><p>&quot;Before my transplant, I would say that I didn’t know where I’d be a month from now,” he said. “But I have a whole new life now and can plan for the future.”\r\n</p>",

      "image": "/content/images/7nxGmPT5RyWW7folaPbBi7.jpg",
      "story": "<p>For some patients, asking for a second opinion may be easier in theory than in practice, especially for those diagnosed with a life-threatening disease.</p><p>In late 2018, Melissa Stucky of Rockton, Illinois was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 34 after finding a lump on her right side. Married with a two-year-old daughter at home and her career as an elementary school speech and language pathologist paused because of her compromised immune system, Melissa’s cancer fight soon extended to her health insurance provider.</p><p>Like many breast cancer patients, especially younger women, Melissa wanted both breasts surgically removed for maximum peace of mind. Her doctors agreed that a double mastectomy was medically appropriate, but her insurance company would only cover the cost of a single mastectomy of her cancerous breast. </p><p>“My doctors submitted the double mastectomy to insurance 9 times, all of which were denied,” Melissa says. “They said I didn’t need a double because I didn’t have a family history of breast cancer or have the gene mutation that increases risk. Initially, I went ahead with the single mastectomy and initial reconstruction, which were done at the hospital affiliated with my insurance company. I wanted the cancer out right away and that was my only option at the time. I also had chemotherapy and radiation done at the same hospital.” </p><p>After hearing great things about UW Health Northern Illinois (formerly SwedishAmerican) from other women in the Rockford area, Melissa became convinced that a second opinion might be the path to a double mastectomy. Doing this meant buying a second health insurance policy through the marketplace, an option available to her thanks to the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”).</p><p>Dr. Lacey Stelle, a breast cancer surgeon who directs UW Health’s Rockford-based breast cancer program, was incredibly helpful. </p><h2>Double mastectomy was totally appropriate</h2><p>“Melissa wasn’t asking for anything unusual by seeking a double mastectomy, especially for such a young woman,” says Dr. Stelle. “Fortunately, her new insurance plan approved it and Melissa had the surgery in May 2021. During my part of the operation, we removed Melissa’s non-cancerous breast and then my UW Health colleague, Dr. Samuel Poore from Plastic Surgery, took over and reconstructed both breasts.” </p><p>(Melissa’s surgery was done in Madison, however patients who live closer to Rockford can now have breast reconstruction performed there by Dr. Katharine Shaum, a UW Health-trained plastic surgeon who specializes in breast work.)</p><p>“Operating on patients who had surgery and/or radiation in the past can be trickier because radiated tissue can become harder and tighter,” says Dr. Poore. “It’s more complicated to work with implants on these patients during reconstruction. Accordingly, we took a bit of muscle and skin from her back and moved it to her chest to produce the most natural outcome on the side where she had been radiated.”</p><p>Breast reconstruction is typically completed with two follow-up surgeries, which Melissa had in July and November of 2021. Her follow-up visits with UW Health medical oncology in Rockford continue every six months.</p><p>Melissa is more than pleased not only with the cosmetic outcome but also the high level of support and communication she received from the UW Health team. </p><p>“When UW Health temporarily stopped doing elective surgeries during the late 2020/early 2021 COVID surge, Dr. Stelle and Dr. Poore communicated with me regularly, letting me know my surgery was a priority,” Melissa says. “I could tell they were working hard to get insurance to approve it and then to schedule the operation as soon as possible.”</p><h2>Advanced breast cancer care now available in Rockford</h2><p>Melissa’s case also illustrates why UW Health’s elevated level of breast cancer care may be a superior option for women from Northern Illinois.</p><p>With both Dr. Stelle and Dr. Shaum working closely together to serve Northern Illinois patients, UW Health’s Northern Illinois breast cancer program is now accredited by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC), a designation from the American College of Surgeons that signifies the highest level of breast cancer care. In highly complex cases, women can be seen at the UW Carbone Cancer Center in Madison — the only cancer center in Wisconsin designated as “comprehensive” by the National Cancer Institute. </p><p>Reflecting on her own experience, Melissa is glad that her quest for a second opinion led to her to UW Health.</p><p>“Sometimes patients worry about offending their provider by seeking a second opinion, but it’s your life,” Melissa says. “You should never be afraid to ask for it. During each of my UW Health stays, everyone was incredibly comforting, explained everything in detail and answered all my questions,” she says. “From the doctors and nurses to the people who draw your blood or clean your room, there was nothing but kindness and respect. Everything was wonderful and I’m very happy how it turned out.”</p><p>Second opinions are available to anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer. Regardless of where a patient ultimately seeks treatment, a second opinion offers peace of mind through confirmation of the original diagnosis and a full understanding of all treatment options when faced with a life-threatening diagnosis. </p>",

      "story": "<p>Recently, a TV medical drama aired an episode about a patient who suffered from a rare, painful problem called loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS). Over the course of the hour-long episode, the woman’s doctors diagnosed her condition, performed a kidney autotransplant and eliminated her pain. And the woman lived happily ever after.</p><p>Josh Young laughed when he saw that episode. He knows from personal experience that it’s not quite so easy—and that a person with LPHS usually must undergo many trials before they can finally find relief. Fortunately, he feels like he has gotten to that point after he found the UW Health Renal Autotransplant Program in Madison, Wisconsin.</p><p>Josh’s problems first started in 2015. The Wylie, Texas, financial advisor was on his way back from a meeting with a client when he experienced crippling pain, sweating and vomiting. At the emergency room, he learned he had a kidney stone—the first of many kidney stones and subsequent trips to the ER. After a while, tests revealed that his kidney stones had passed, but Josh continued to experience debilitating pain and blood in his urine. Over the next few years, he had several surgeries to remove kidney stones and repair his kidney.</p><p>After the first three or four ER trips, caregivers at Josh’s local hospital labeled him as a drug-seeker. “I just dreaded going to the ER, but I knew that’s what I had to do to get my symptoms under control,” he said. “I told them, ‘I can’t fake this. I can’t fake the blood that’s in my urine.’”</p><p>Josh’s wife, Crystal, an intensive care unit nurse, worked with a nephrologist who printed out an article about LPHS, a condition characterized by extreme flank pain and blood in the urine. They determined that’s what Josh had, but there were no easy answers. Even when they traveled across the country to visit other renowned medical centers, doctors told him he was just going to have to live with the pain.</p><p>He found support groups via social media and learned that UW Health had a treatment—a renal autotransplant in which the surgeon removes the ureter and kidney and puts it in a different part of the body—but Josh didn’t think he was a candidate. After connecting with the UW Health team, he decided to fly to Wisconsin and check it out.</p><p>In July 2019, Josh underwent an autotransplant on his left kidney. “Everything was amazing for several months,” he says. “But during my first follow-up visit, we talked about the possibility that the problems could move to the other kidney.”</p><p>Sure enough, they did. In early 2020, Josh started feeling similar pain near his right kidney. However, the world was completely locked down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so he lived with the pain while waiting for travel to be safe. In September 2021, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080</span>, medical director of the renal autotransplant program at UW Health, performed an autotransplant on his right kidney, and he and Crystal stayed at Restoring Hope Transplant House in Middleton, Wisconsin, while he recovered. “Restoring Hope was really a blessing to me and my family, as well as many others,” he says.</p><p>The autotransplant was successful, and his pain is gone. “Dr. Foley and Dr. Danobeitia were angels on earth in my treatment, diagnosis and surgical transplant procedures,” he says. “After the most recent transplant, I ended up in the ER with internal bleeding from ulcers, and they rushed to my side in the ER and were extremely attentive during my recovery.”</p><p>Josh’s journey hasn’t echoed a TV medical drama. He endured multiple surgeries for kidney stones and an anatomical kidney repair before his first transplant, and three other stone removals before and after his second transplant, but now Josh is back to living his life. He works full time, and when he’s at home, he plays with his 5-year-old daughter, Ivy. “I’m playing catch-up on all those moments I lost with my daughter—going to the park, dancing and just being together.”</p><p>In February 2022, he attended a daddy-daughter dance with Ivy, dressing up in his nicest suit and picking her up at the front door. “I’m back to being a dad and husband, and not just being locked up in the bedroom all the time,” he says.</p><p>While Josh considered locations closer to home for his second autotransplant, he chose UW Health. “The care was phenomenal,” he says. “My wife, the ICU nurse, said they run this place so, so well.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Same-day surgery can treat hypospadias, a birth defect affecting a baby boy’s “pee hole.&quot;</p><p>Because it is so seldom discussed publicly, parents are often surprised to learn that a birth defect that affects about one in 250 baby boys – known as hypospadias – is more common than one might think.</p><p>Instead of peeing through a hole located at the tip of the penis, babies with this condition have their “pee hole,” or opening of the urethra, located in a slightly abnormal place. Sometimes it is off to one side. Other times it may appear further down the urethra, occasionally reaching close to the anus.  </p><p>More than a cosmetic problem, hypospadias can make boys self-conscious as they get older. It can be difficult for these kids to avoid spraying their feet while peeing, so many boys choose to sit while urinating. Some may notice a downward curve of the penis or incomplete foreskin, resulting in a hooded appearance. Regardless, having an abnormality like this can be psychologically harmful because it can be very difficult to talk about. </p><p>Nobody really knows what causes hypospadias. Some think it has a genetic origin. Other theories suggest it may have to do with environmental factors, such as pollution or insecticides.</p><p>Regardless of its cause, the good news is that hypospadias can almost  always be remedied by surgery, ideally performed when the child is between  6 and 18 months old. While children with very mild cases may do fine without surgery, UW Health pediatric urologists are available to meet with any family whose child is diagnosed with hypospadias. </p><h2>Arriving at a shared decision about surgery</h2><p>“We spend as much as time as the family wishes to make sure every question is answered so we arrive at a shared decision about surgery,” says UW Health pediatric urologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11173</span>, who has operated on more than 1,000 patients with hypospadias over the past 20 years. </p><p>Kami, a south-central Wisconsin mother whose 16-month-old son was born with hypospadias, was referred to UW Health pediatric urologist Walid Farhat, MD, by her local pediatrician. </p><p>“Dr. Farhat assured us that this was more common than we thought,” Kami says. “Knowing that he has done more than 1,000 surgeries on boys like ours assured us that he would be in good hands.”</p><p>As Dr. Farhat advised, Kami and her husband waited until their son was 7 months old to have the surgery. When the day came, they arrived at American Family Children’s Hospital at 8 am for the surgery, which typically lasts between one and two hours. By 3 pm, their little guy was doing well enough for the family to head home. </p><h2>Family decided that sooner was better </h2><p>“The hardest part was knowing he had to go under anesthesia,” she says. “Of course we had the option of waiting on surgery, but the more we thought about it, the more we didn’t want this to be something he had to deal with as he got to be 3 or 4 or even older.”</p><p>Once her son was home for a week, he was almost totally recovered.</p><p>“The doctors and nurses were great,” Kami says. “They really put us at ease by assuring us how many of these surgeries they have done and by explaining every little thing they were going to do and why they were doing it.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Ask Ephraim Vilmin about his liver transplant, and the 6-year-old will tell you in no uncertain terms that it was not the highlight of his life.</p><p>“I wish it didn’t even happen in the first place,” he declares emphatically, even as his parents silently thank their lucky stars that he was able to receive a transplant.</p><p>Because without it, the Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, boy probably wouldn’t be alive today.</p><p>Ephraim’s health problems began just before Thanksgiving 2020, when he started showing symptoms of a cold and of jaundice. After he lost his appetite and the whites of his eyes turned yellow, his parents brought him to the emergency room. Doctors at the local hospital transferred him to American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison via ambulance in the middle of the night.</p><p>The little boy had developed acute liver failure from a suspected virus, and for two weeks, doctors ran test after test as they tried to determine what had caused the virus—and how they could best treat him. As Ephraim became sicker and sicker, his medical team decided to put him on the transplant wait list. But he would receive a transplant quickest, they told his parents, if he had a living donor. UW Health is a certified living liver donation center, so Ephraim’s dad, Josiah, stepped up for testing. Josiah already knew he had the same blood type as Ephraim, and further testing confirmed he would be a good match.</p><p>“His lab results were coming back pretty bad, and there were no deceased donor organs available that would work,” says Ephraim’s mother, Connie. “We needed to have Josiah go through the living donation process very quickly.”</p><p>Indeed, just 24 hours after Josiah started the testing process, he and Ephraim were wheeled into separate ope</p><p>rating rooms, where UW Health transplant surgeons removed part of Josiah’s liver and placed it in Ephraim’s body.</p><p>The transplant saved Ephraim’s life. However, it would be a long time before the Vilmins would be able to exhale.</p><div></div><h2>Another health problem</h2><p>After his surgery, Ephraim’s lab results were slowly returning to normal, however, just before Christmas they discovered he was suffering from a complication called aplastic anemia that can occur with acute liver failure that is caused by a virus. His bone marrow wasn’t working properly, so they had to put him on even more medications. “It was more than a setback, because if the treatment didn’t work, Ephraim would need a bone marrow transplant,” says Josiah.</p><p>As he began feeling better, Ephraim rode a tricycle up and down the halls of the cancer treatment unit at the hospital. His lab results still weren’t great, but after 65 days in the hospital, he returned home at the end of January 2021. He had two more hospitalizations later in 2021 because he developed a fever—a condition that can be very dangerous for a boy in his condition. </p><p>Near the end of 2021, the Vilmins were relieved to see Ephraim continuing to improve. He no longer required treatment for aplastic anemia, and the number of medications he took every day dropped from 12 to one. They decided to enroll him in a virtual 1st grade class so he wouldn’t be exposed to other children while COVID-19 still raged through the United States.</p><p>While he’s not thrilled to be attending school at home, Ephraim is excelling in his classes and finally getting the opportunity to enjoy life with his new liver. “He’s fantastic,” says Josiah. “If you saw him, you wouldn’t know there was anything wrong with him. He’s perfect in every way.”</p><p>And Josiah is feeling good, too. Both he and Connie appreciate the care their family received at UW Health—and the fact that living liver donation was even an option for them in the first place. “I don’t think Ephraim would be here if we didn’t have the option of a living donor,” says Connie.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Sarah and Ryan Judd still can’t fathom the stunning turn of events that befell their little girl, Kinsley, just after she turned one year old in June 2021. Once they learned that their baby had cancer, each day for this beautiful family from Davis, Illinois would come filled with countless physical, emotional and logistical challenges.</p><p>It began when Kinsley came down with a stubborn ear infection, but even more concerning, this incredibly sweet, joyful and energetic child lost her “mojo.” Now, all she wanted to do was cuddle in her mom or dad’s lap. Sarah, an elementary school principal, took her daughter to their local pediatrician, who found highly concerning low red and white cell counts in Kinsley’s blood. </p><p>“You need to take her to Madison right away,” said the local pediatrician, and within an hour, Kinsley and her parents arrived at UW Health’s Emergency Department. </p><p>After the family was settled in a patient care room, Dr. Greg Rebella, a UW Health Kids Emergency Medicine doctor, asked Sarah a simple question.</p><p>“What is your biggest concern right now?” he said.</p><p>“That she is not going to make it,” replied Sarah.</p><p>After doctors confirmed the diagnosis that all signs were pointing to — leukemia — or cancer of the blood, Dr. Rebella rightly sensed that Sarah and Ryan’s heads were spinning with worry.</p><p>“Dr. Rebella went out of his way to comfort us,” Sarah says. “He told us that leukemia survival rates for children are much higher than those for adults and chances were good that Kinsley would be ok. It made a huge difference at a moment when our world had just been turned upside down.”</p><h2>Family life underwent big changes</h2><p>While there might be a light at the end of the tunnel, the other end of the tunnel seemed far away. The Judds would devote the next six months to helping Kinsley keep her spark even while most of that time would be spent in the hospital. </p><p>With Sarah and Ryan living an hour’s drive away, coordinating schedules was no easy task to ensure that at least one parent was at the hospital with Kinsley while both spouses held down full-time jobs. </p><div></div><p>“Most children with leukemia have the type known as ALL, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia,” says Kinsley’s UW Health Kids oncologist, Dr. Cathy Lee-Miller. “Kinsley’s leukemia, however, is called AML, or acute myeloid leukemia. Because this type of disease is more aggressive, we must treat it more aggressively. It was not an easy road, but she tolerated it well. Her cancer went into remission after the first month, but we still had to keep treating her for six months to give Kinsley the best chance for long-term survival.”</p><p>While no family would choose to spend so much time in the hospital with their child, Sarah and Ryan’s unwavering commitment to make hospital life as normal, if not fun-filled as possible, allowed their daughter not only to heal physically but emotionally as well. By trusting the doctors, nurses, therapists and child life specialists, Sarah and Ryan set the tone for Kinsley to view her care team as an extension of her family.</p><p>“When the doctors and nurses come around each morning to talk about the plan for the day, the hospital calls it rounding,” Sarah says. “We called them Kinsley’s parties. We were in the best place possible, surrounded by the best people,” Sarah says. “They did an incredible job not only meeting Kinsley’s needs but ours too, and that meant everything when your child is fighting cancer.”</p><h2>A real social butterfly</h2><p>Although her hospital stay began when she was just 13 months old, Kinsley left an unforgettable impression on everyone she met.</p><p>“Everybody loves her,” says Dr. Lee-Miller. “She was the ‘mayor’ of the floor — a real social butterfly.”</p><p>If she wasn’t exactly campaigning for votes, Kinsley quickly learned how to elicit laughs.</p><div></div><p>“Her raised eyebrows and little dances made everyone’s day,” says oncology nurse Lynae Meinholz. “She would do this little shimmy when the doctors and nurses came to round on her and crack everyone up.”</p><p>“She loved blowing big kisses to people in the hallway,” adds oncology nurse Jordyn Schemenauer. “She really is pure joy in a child.”</p><p>Nursing assistant Samantha (Sam) Fargo calls Kinsley her best friend throughout the six-month hospitalization.</p><p>“She started out hating me,” says Fargo. “We really clicked once I taught her how to stick her tongue out or pound on the table if she was hungry. Her parents thought it was hilarious.” </p><h2>Kids are incredibly resilient </h2><p>Caring for children like Kinsley each day brings great perspective, says Fargo.</p><p>“Anyone who spends five minutes with these kids and families learns quickly not to take anything for granted,” she says.</p><p>“People often think what we do is so sad,” adds Schemenauer. “No kid should have to grow up in a hospital, but our fulfillment comes through seeing how incredibly resilient kids are, even when they are being treated for cancer.”</p><p>Without question, not every day was a picnic for Kinsley. Overall, however, Sarah and Ryan’s desire to create the most playful environment for their daughter clearly helped Kinsley thrive.</p><p>“She would read books, cook with her play kitchen, dance all the time and make music with the music therapist,” Sarah says. “She even learned to walk in the hospital and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas there. Everyone we met went above and beyond for her and we will be grateful for that forever.”</p><p>Looking forward, Kinsley will receive close follow-up care for the next several years.</p><p>“Her body will feel the effects of the treatment for a while,” says Dr. Lee-Miller. “Developmentally, she should catch up to her peers fairly quickly.”</p><p>Few will forget how much joy Kinsley spread in the hospital, even though she won’t remember the experience herself.</p><p>“Kids as young as Kinsley don’t remember, but the parents, of course, never forget,” says Dr. Lee-Miller. “Kinsley’s parents always prioritized surrounding Kinsley with love and there’s no doubt how much their attitude helped Kinsley get through the toughest times.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Stephanie Schuldes was not expected to live as a baby.</p><p>That she survived at all was truly incredible. That she is about to turn 29 years old is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>It was early 1991. Baby Stephanie was so pale as an infant that her grandmother instinctively knew something was wrong.</p><p>“We’re white people,” said Stephanie’s mother, Susan, trying to convince herself that her baby’s white-as-snow appearance wasn’t that abnormal.</p><p>“We’re not this white,” said Susan’s mother, Bonnie Spiegelberg.</p><p>As they were visiting Susan’s sister in Wausau, Wis., the family took their 7-week old infant to a local pediatrician.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s wrong with this baby, but she is very ill and needs to get to a specialist right away,” said the doctor.</p><p>While the pediatrician started a series of tests on Stephanie, Susan instantly realized how sick her baby was.</p><p>“She’s got leukemia,” she told her mother.</p><p>Soon, Susan’s instinct would be proven correct. Stephanie was flown by helicopter to Madison, where the on-call UW Health pediatric hematologist/oncologist – Dr. Paul Gaynon – managed the situation at University of Wisconsin Children’s Hospital, the forerunner of today’s American Family Children’s Hospital.</p><p>“I was told there was a baby in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with pneumonia and a high white blood count,” recalls Dr. Gaynon, who currently practices at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.</p><h4>It was leukemia – and it wasn’t good</h4><p>“I first attributed Stephanie’s high white blood count to pneumonia, but when I learned that the count was more than 500,000 – normal is 5,000 to 10,000 – I knew she had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the outlook was not at all good.”</p><p>Stephanie’s blood was drawn into a syringe and Susan could barely believe her eyes.</p><p>“Her blood looked like lemonade,” Susan says. “It was virtually all leukemia cells. There were almost no visible red blood cells.”</p><p>As Dr. Gaynon told the family, most childhood cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are diagnosed at preschool age or older. Infant ALL is very rare, occurring in perhaps 100 babies per year in the US. Even today, only about one-third of infants who are diagnosed at less than 3 months of age survive.</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9040</span>, a UW Health pediatric hematologist/oncologist, says most infants have a gene rearrangement called KMT2A that helps make the cancer very aggressive. “By the time a child is age 1 or older,” he says, “the KMT2A gene is present perhaps only 5 percent of the time.”</p><p>“This means,” adds Dr. Gaynon, “that older kids with ALL can be more easily treated and better tolerate the treatment – difficult as it may be,” he says. “Infants, however, are at great risk for serious neurocognitive side effects and present great challenges with regard to nutrition, infection and diaper care.”</p><p>Susan Schuldes could barely take in all this information she was hearing. All she knew was that her baby was critically ill, and – this was life before cell phones – she could not reach her husband, who was on a fishing trip in northern Wisconsin.</p><p>“A neighbor went out on a boat and found him,” Susan says. “When he finally got to a phone, my sister told him about Stephanie, and he drove to Madison immediately.”</p><p>As Dr. Gaynon and the Schuldes family weighed the magnitude of the situation, it was impossible to look more than even a few hours ahead.</p><h4>Stephanie begins experimental chemotherapy protocol</h4><p>They agreed to a then-experimental chemotherapy regimen that included Methotrexate, a drug that interferes with the reproduction of cancer cells. Because she was so young, Stephanie was not given radiation therapy because of the high risk for brain damage.</p><p>She was initially hospitalized for 30 days and repeatedly returned to Madison for chemotherapy over the next 2½ years. During several of these hospitalizations, Stephanie would sleep almost 24 hours a day for 7 to 10 days.</p><div></div><p>“At the time we gave Stephanie her maintenance chemotherapy, it was done by injection, which we called &#39;getting a poke&#39; to kids,” says recently retired UW Health pediatric hematology/oncology nurse practitioner Sharon Frierdich, “Stephanie would sit on her mom’s lap and listen to a cheerful song from my Mickey Mouse watch, which would distract her.”</p><p>Against long odds, Stephanie’s chemotherapy did its job and she reached remission. By age 12, she was pronounced cancer-free. Stephanie had a few physical delays as a toddler, but otherwise experienced no ill-effects from her disease or treatment.</p><h4>The miracle of 29</h4><p>The incredible miracle about this little girl, however, lies in a simple number: 29.</p><p>The little baby few thought would survive in 1991 will – incredibly – turn 29 years old on her next birthday in March 2020.</p><p>Stephanie grew up with her family in Appleton, Wis., graduated high school with a 4.0 grade point average and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She also earned a master’s degree from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and works in Wisconsin as a licensed speech-language pathologist in pediatrics. During her free time, Stephanie swims, runs and spends plenty of time enjoying the outdoors.</p><div></div><p>“My treatment was finished before I turned 3, so I’m lucky that I don’t remember the bad parts,” says Stephanie. “Over the years, I came in for check-ups in the pediatric cancer Caring for Life Clinic until age 25. I looked forward to seeing my nurse, Sharon, every visit.”</p><p>Stephanie knows how lucky she is, especially because so few babies diagnosed with leukemia go on to live such a normal, healthy life.</p><p>“There really is nothing that stops me from doing what I want to do,” she says. “To come away from what I went through being cured and without severe side effects is almost inconceivable.”</p><h4>A walking miracle</h4><p>If you met Stephanie Schuldes, you would never know that she is a genuine walking miracle. Her father, Michael, calls Stephanie his personal hero.</p><p>“She taught me that some things in life are really important, while others may seem that way but, when given time to reflect, are not,” he says. “She also says that life is precious and to make the most of each day.”</p><p>Michael and Susan, who now live in Waukesha, Wis., know what it means to give back, having spent a decade on the board of the Wisconsin Chapter of the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. They also ran a golf outing benefiting that organization for 15 years.</p><p>Reflecting on those anxious days and nights with their little girl during cancer treatment, the Schuldes family will never forget what UW Health did not only for Stephanie, but for her parents as well.</p><p>“UW saved our daughter’s life and took great care of Michael and me as parents,” Susan says. “Stephanie has a couple of physical scars, but because she was so young, her father and I have all the emotional scars. Nobody would choose to go through this, but the childhood cancer team in Madison was wonderful and we are forever grateful.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>It may not be the type of anniversary everyone would choose to celebrate. Forty years ago, Joel Everts, then age 9, sacrificed a leg and part of his pelvic bone to save his life not long after being diagnosed with an aggressive bone cancer known as osteosarcoma.</p><p>Now a 49-year-old sports sales manager with Discover Green Bay, the Green Bay area’s tourism office, Joel takes his 40th “ampu-versary” in stride, not unlike the way he initially took the devastating diagnosis that left a young boy wondering if he was going to die.</p><p>Joel’s story, then and now, begins with his undying passion for sports.</p><p>“I played basketball, baseball, soccer and swam as a kid. I couldn’t get enough of sports,” Joel says of his childhood in Janesville, Wisconsin. </p><p>When Joel uncharacteristically asked to be taken out of a soccer game because of a stubborn pain in his knee, his mother, Joan (pronounced “Joanne”) knew something was wrong.</p><p>Initially, the local orthopedic doctor didn’t find anything of concern but as the family was headed down the hallway to leave, the doctor noticed something unusual in Joel’s walk and asked him to come back. </p><p>“He took some more X-rays of Joel’s hip,” Joan says. “The films showed advanced disease — presumably bone cancer — in the left hip joint,” Joan says. </p><p>The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota was among a handful of medical centers recommended for Joel because of its expertise in treating his type of osteosarcoma. </p><p>During the summer following third grade, Joel recalls the moment before receiving anesthesia just before a leg and hip biopsy.</p><h2>Would Joel wake up without a leg?</h2><p>“They told me if the biopsy showed cancer, they would also amputate, and I would wake up after surgery without my leg.”</p><p>As he started to come to following the procedure, Joel lifted the bed sheet. His left leg was entirely gone.</p><p>“That was the a-ha moment,” Joel says. “My family has a dry sense of humor, so I remember thinking that at least we will have good parking when we go to baseball games.”</p><div></div><p>After four months following the amputation, Joel was fitted for his first prosthesis, or artificial leg. About two months later, thanks to a close buddy who wrote a letter about Joel that found its way to the Milwaukee Brewers, Joel got to hang out with the team in the dugout prior to a late season game at County Stadium during the club’s 1982 American League pennant drive. Brewer greats such as Cecil Cooper, Paul Molitor, Robin Yount and Rollie Fingers autographed baseballs for Joel, who also chatted with then-Manager Harvey Kuenn, himself a partial leg amputee due to a blood clot. </p><p>In early 1983, X-rays revealed more cancer in Joel’s lungs, and surgeons promptly removed the tumors. Because the cancer had spread, however, Joel’s survival was far from certain. Some doctors seemed to give up on Joel, but the Evertses liked what they heard after a visit to University Hospital in Madison to see Dr. Michael Trigg, then a UW Health Kids pediatric oncologist and now a Tampa, Florida-based oncology medical consultant to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.</p><h2>Chemo was tough, but it kept Joel alive</h2><p>“We knew more treatment would be hard on Joel, but there was little choice,” says Joan. “Dr. Trigg saved his life by going after the cancer with high-dose chemotherapy. They didn’t have the same kind of anti-nausea drugs that are widely available today. As the treatments continued, the side effects escalated. Eventually, Joel would get nauseous or vomit during the car ride to Madison — a symptom doctors referred to as anticipatory nausea. There were times he wanted to quit and times we wondered if we should keep putting him through it.”</p><p>Dr. Trigg, a UW faculty physician from 1981-86, remembers Joel well. </p><p>“He was a delightful young man and a favorite among the nursing staff at the hospital,” says Dr. Trigg. “His treatment was not easy because chemotherapy was more toxic than what is given nowadays. Still, we did what we could to keep Joel alive and thankfully he is here today doing great things.”</p><p>Joel completed his course of 22 chemotherapy cycles in 1984 at age 11. The climb was hard to reclaim his strength, but he got there with plenty of support from his family, friends and teachers. </p><p>“School was not a problem for Joel,” says Joan. “He was a smart kid.” </p><p>Losing a leg didn’t mean losing the chance to stay active in sports for Joel. He played basketball on one leg in 7th and 8th grade and during his first year of high school. </p><p>Joel didn’t complain or show signs of self-pity. If someone offered him assistance in the cafeteria line, he’d respectfully refuse. And when younger kids stared at him, he’d jokingly tell them to eat plenty of spinach, or they might lose a leg too.</p><h2>Hasn’t used a prosthesis in more than 20 years</h2><p>By the time Joel graduated from UW-Eau Claire in 1995, where he earned a degree in journalism/advertising, he stopped using a prosthesis altogether.</p><p>“I was getting a new artificial leg every two years and that process was quite an ordeal,” Joel recalls. “Over time, I built up my muscles to the point where I could hop around more efficiently with two crutches. I haven’t used a prosthesis for more than 20 years.”</p><p>Joel is proud of his 24-year career in sports marketing. Among his accomplishments are convincing the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) to move its annual Girls High School Basketball Tournament from Madison to the Green Bay area beginning in 2013. </p><p>Divorced with no children, Joel remains grateful to Dr. Trigg and the UW Health Kids cancer team that cared for him four decades ago. </p><p>“They were just wonderful,” recalls his mother, Joan. “We’re so thankful that Dr. Trigg went after the cancer with everything he had. Joel’s nurses were so kind and caring too.”</p><p>One of them, Sharon Frierdich, retired in 2019 after 37 years as a UW Health Kids oncology nurse practitioner. </p><p>“Joel just took things in stride and adapted to his amputation,” Sharon says. “He simply didn’t let that get him down, and his parents were very supportive.”</p><p>During their frequent hospital stays in Madison, Joel’s father, Steve, gained popularity by taking artwork requests from other hospitalized kids.</p><p>“He would paint their favorite cartoon character on the window in their rooms,” Joel says. </p><p>His parents, naturally, are extraordinarily grateful that their son is alive. They’re also proud of all their son has accomplished.</p><p>“Joel really loves his work and has never allowed his amputation to get in the way of making the most of himself,” Steve says.</p><p>“Forty years!” he says, almost in disbelief. “The odds were against his survival, but thanks to God and the care he got at UW, we get to keep celebrating this miracle.”</p>",

Rob’s arthritic hip, he was told, would continue to deteriorate and about five years later, the pain became more noticeable, as was a limp in his walk.\n\r</p><h3>Recovery was much longer 15 years ago</h3><p>“I looked into hip replacement surgery, but back then the recovery period was 10 to 12 weeks and I was simply not going to give up that much time,” Rob said. “I stopped running but still kept golfing fairly often. I even got to play one of my best rounds on a course where the British Open is held but the pain got worse once I got back.”\n\r\nLittle by little, more of what Rob loved from life was being taken away. Tennis was the next casualty and even routine household chores escaped his reach. A UW Health spine specialist referred Rob to Dr. Nickel in early 2021, when Rob realized that he couldn’t put off hip replacements much longer.\n\r\n“Dr. Nickel looked at my hip X-rays taken in 2018 and couldn’t believe I was able to still walk. Then, after new X-rays were taken, he said my right hip was one of the worst he had seen. And just for good measure, he said my left hip was not far behind.”\n\r\nLike any good reporter, Rob did his research before signing up for two hip replacements.\r\n\n“By 2021, I learned how dramatically things had changed for the better since I first looked into hip replacements about 10 years prior,” Rob said. “Nickel told me that he can never make any guarantees, but he was very confident that each hip should be totally healed in just two months, meaning I would soon get back to the activities I was missing without pain. His confident, reassuring manner was very uplifting and that also made me comfortable going ahead with it.”\n\r</p><h3>Surgery couldn’t have gone more smoothly \r</h3><p>In February 2021 at age 73 and still in good shape, Rob underwent the first of his two hip replacements. By all accounts, it could not have gone more smoothly. Rob was home the next day, where he received plenty of help from his wife Cindy and lots of meals from friends and neighbors.\n\r\n“People were great to us and that means so much in recovery.” Rob said. “After a month, I was already feeling that this would be a life-changer.”\n\r\nHe opted to wait until summer was over to have the second operation. The day of surgery, Rob was anything but nervous laying on the table.\n\r\n“I remember looking up at Nickel and the whole team as I was about to go under anesthesia,” Rob said. “They were smiling at me saying, ‘Are you ready for this?’ Honestly, I felt excited more than anything.”\n\r\nTwo and a half months after his second hip replacement, Rob’s biggest concern is knowing how tired his wife and friends are from listening to his euphoric spiel about his new, pain-free life.\n\r\n“When you get to be my age and they can actually do something that gives you your life back after 10 to 15 years of decline, that is truly amazing.” Rob said.\n\r\nRob’s praises extend beyond Dr. Nickel to the whole joint replacement team, based at <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L280</span>.\n\r</p><h3>Pain level is now &#39;zero&#39;</h3><p>“People seem to grumble more than ever these days about how service in general has been declining, but honestly, everyone involved with my care at (East Madison Hospital) was on top of their game,” Rob said. “They said they could take my pain away and they delivered. I would give them a 10 in every category except my pain — which I now put at zero.”\n\r\nA Milwaukee native, published author of two books and father of three grown daughters, Rob looks forward to spending more quality time with his friends and high school sweetheart wife of 52 years, Cindy.\n\r\n“I’ve got dreams,” Rob said, ranging from getting back on the tennis court to playing basketball with his granddaughter to taking Cindy to one of their favorite vacation spots: Zihuatanejo, Mexico — an oceanside community beautifully described in a memorable scene by Tim Robbins’ character, Andy, in the film “The Shawshank Redemption.”\n\r\n“I’m just anxious to start re-engaging in life again,” Rob said. “And I’ve told my friends they better be ready to play a lot of golf next year.”\n\r\nIf there is anything Dr. Nickel hopes others might take from Rob’s story, it’s his advice not to believe the persistent myths and misinformation about joint replacement surgery.\n\r\n“People hear or read things that stem from how joint replacements were performed in the ‘80s or ‘90s,” Nickel said. “Hip and knee surgery really started to advance while I was training at Duke about 10 years ago. Today, patients are usually up walking 3 hours after surgery, and many go home the same day. If they follow through with the physical therapy — both before and after surgery — an overwhelming majority of patients have the same results as Rob.”\r\n\r\nRob may have benefited from being in good physical shape before surgery, Nickel said, but most patients who work hard have a substantial improvement in their quality of life.\n\r\n“It’s very gratifying to have such a great surgical answer for so many people who suffer from chronic pain,” Nickel said. “It’s almost instant gratification seeing the difference we can make for so many.”\n\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin Hospitals, part of UW Health, are among the best in the nation in orthopedics, routinely ranked in the top 20 in this specialty (including a No. 15 national ranking in 2021) by U.S. News &amp; World Report.  Academia and sub-specialization foster the highest possible care in the region for patients, and outcomes like Rob’s encourage the team to continuously improve for the benefit of all patients.\r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>It is hard to imagine anyone better qualified to calm anxious families of patients facing surgery than Tanya Nelson</b>, a woman who is incredibly determined not to let an extraordinarily rare bone disease steal her spirit, let alone her quality of life.</p><p>A Guest Services Ambassador in the Surgical Waiting Area at East Madison Hospital, Tanya is one of approximately 900 people in the world who lives with a disease called fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).</p><p>Also known as Stoneman Syndrome, FOP causes patients to produce unwanted bone throughout their body, long after the time most of us stop growing bone. These patients essentially grow a “second skeleton,” in which tendons, muscles and ligaments continuously turn into bone at the slightest provocation. Even a routine injection in the arm can trigger the body to produce more unwanted bone. There is no cure, and many patients are bedridden by their 20s.</p><p>Tanya, 48, recalls experiencing symptoms as early as age 13.</p><p> “When doctors first discovered that I was producing extra bone,” she said, “they naturally wanted to remove it, but that is actually the last thing you want to do because the trauma of surgery makes the body angry and it responds by producing even more abnormal bone.”</p><p>She was not formally diagnosed with FOP until 2001, five years before the genetic cause of the disease was discovered. Then 29, Tanya found some relief in finally knowing the cause of her pain and mobility limitations, even though she was the unlucky one in 2 million to be saddled with this devastating diagnosis.</p><p>“It’s easier to say where my body is not affected rather than where it is,” Tanya said. “My back, my hip, my shoulder…they all hurt and the disease has impacted my ability to walk for years.”</p><p>Since 2001, Tanya has been seen at UW Health’s <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C879</span>, located at the Waisman Center. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9753</span>, MD, a pediatrician and specialist in bone dysplasia who runs this clinic, has treated Tanya for the past five years. </p><h3>Sole FOP patient at UW Health</h3><p>“Tanya is the only patient with FOP in our clinic,” said Dr. Legare. “While there are guidelines for treating patients with FOP, it is really important to focus on Tanya the person, not the textbook ways to treat her  disease. Listening – really listening – is one of the most important things we as physicians can do, especially with a patient whose situation is as far from routine as you can imagine.”</p><p>Unfortunately, things for Tanya took a big turn for the worse in 2017, when her right leg essentially gave up.</p><p>“My hip flexor contracted and felt like someone took a razor to my hip,” Tanya said. “While I always had walked with a limp, this really impinged my ability to walk at all. My leg was flexed at an angle, making it hard for me to sleep. I was a hobbling, gruesome looking mess.” Somewhere around this time, Tanya tore her labrum, the ring of cartilage that surrounds the hip socket, also contributing to her increasing disability.</p><p>The next 2½ years challenged Tanya like never before. She tried everything from physical therapy to Botox injections, which gave limited relief. Her UW Health physical therapist, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10163</span>, never gave up trying to help Tanya accommodate her limitations.</p><p>By summer 2019, Tanya had reached a dark place. Her pain was not improving despite her best efforts and her quality of life was diminishing. Almost out of desperation, she casually approached UW Health orthopedic surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10321</span>, DO, a physician she knew from her workplace, and asked if he would see her in clinic.</p><h3>Orthopedic surgeon considers treatment options</h3><p>“Of course, I was willing to see Tanya,” Dr. Walczak said. “Before doing anything, however, I needed to really understand her situation by letting her tell her story and then conferring with Dr. Legare and David Anderson. I also suggested that we do some imaging to get a better look at what was going on with her hip.”</p><p>An MRI confirmed that Tanya had a labrum tear. It also showed that extra bone in her iliopsoas muscle near the hip joint was pinching the labrum, all of which contributed to her pain and lack of mobility.</p><p>If he was treating a “routine” patient, Dr. Walczak would have suggested doing open surgery. Because of her disease, however, doing open surgery on Tanya would put her at great risk for still more unwanted bone growth due to the traumatic impact of surgery on the body. Another option was to do nothing, a choice Tanya found unacceptable. </p><p>By October 2019, Dr. Walczak suggested that Tanya might be able to tolerate a different kind of surgery — one he typically performs on athletes with hip disorders. Tanya was intrigued.</p><p>“He thought he might be able to bring some of my range of motion back and allow me to start walking again,” Tanya said. “He gave me hope.” </p><p>“The idea,” said Dr. Walczak, “by using a minimally invasive approach, was to repair the labral tear without touching any muscle, minimizing risk for future bone growth. Instead, we would lengthen Tanya’s psoas tendon, which is one of the hip flexor tendons. By navigating around the muscles, I thought we could achieve enough improvement to justify the surgery.”</p><p>In January 2020, Tanya was taken to the operating room for what she believed might be her last, best chance at a better life. To minimize inflammation or swelling from surgery — and keep the body from getting “angry” — Dr. Legare and Dr. Walczak prescribed a course of steroids for before and after the operation.</p><h3>Minimally invasive surgery yields huge improvement</h3><p>Dr. Walczak was thrilled by the outcome, which exceeded his own expectations.</p><p>He was able to move Tanya’s hip, which had been flexed at a 45-degree angle, to lie straight on the operating table. This gave him the access be needed to trim the torn pieces of Tanya’s labrum, smooth the remaining labrum and remove bone fragments.</p><p>“If we did well, I was expecting to accomplish 50 percent of what we normally achieve for other patients,” Dr. Walczak said. “We actually achieved 95 percent, which was incredibly encouraging.”</p><p>Tanya knew right away that the surgery worked.</p><p>“I was off the pain meds by the second day, and when they ran out, I said, ‘Holy cow! I don’t hurt,’” she said. “I don’t think I realized just how bad it really was until after I wasn’t in that kind of pain.”</p><p>Today, nearly five months after surgery, Tanya’s pain level on a 10-point scale typically sits at 1 or 2 — and sometimes even zero. She walks 1.8 miles a day (plus several thousand daily steps at work) and was looking forward to resuming water aerobics classes.</p><p>“Tanya’s quality of life is even greater than I expected. It’s so inspiring to see her walking around, happy and confident, especially knowing that what we did was part of a team approach,” said Dr. Walczak, adding that Tanya herself was the key player on the team.</p><p>“As Dr. Legare says, you really have to look beyond the disease and listen to the patient. When you only look at the disease, all you see are risks, but Tanya helped convince us to see possibilities we may not have seen right away. She is, no doubt, among the top two or three most inspiring patients I’ve had the privilege to care for.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>John DeSimone is a self-described people person. </p><p>The 74-year-old native of Brooklyn, N.Y., can easily befriend a complete stranger in minutes with his colorful personality. Listening to John discuss his recent shoulder replacement surgery is both inspiring and entertaining.</p><p>&quot;The meter was running on my body and I was doing a lot of compensating during the last two years,&quot; John said. &quot;If I reached for the low shelf in my kitchen cabinet to put dishes away, the pain was excruciating. Same when I tried to shave. My shoulder was just a mess.&quot;</p><p>After a 41-year career selling television advertising in various spots across the country, John moved to Madison in 2014 to accept his final job in broadcasting, serving as general manager of WMSN (Ch. 47) in Madison. Four years later, as his career was winding down, the pain in his right shoulder — an area of concern for decades — intensified significantly.</p><p> He surmises that his shoulder problems originated in high school, when the 5-foot-5, 135-pound running back got whacked on the football field by plenty of guys 75 to 100 pounds heavier. He&#39;s remained physically active throughout his life, but as it does for many, age has taken a toll on his body.</p><p> &quot;By the time I turned 70, I had almost no rotator cuff in my right shoulder,&quot; John said, referring to the set of four tendons that work in conjunction with the deltoid muscle to ensure proper shoulder stability and mobility.</p><h3>Standard shoulder replacement wasn&#39;t an option</h3><p> Unfortunately for John, standard total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement) surgery — in which old bone and muscle are replaced with new smooth metal and plastic parts — typically offers little help for patients with a severely torn rotator cuff.</p><p>&quot;Without a functioning rotator cuff,&quot; says UW Health orthopedic surgeon <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/brian-f-grogan-md/10943\">Brian Grogan</a>, MD, &quot;standard anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty will not work.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately for John, however, Dr. Grogan is one of the few experts in the region specializing in shoulder and elbow surgery. He is able to perform an alternate type of shoulder surgery known as reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement).</p><p>&quot;With a standard anatomic total shoulder replacement, we insert a new metal ball on the top of the humerus, or upper arm bone, which fits nicely into a new plastic socket that we build into the cavity of the shoulder blade,&quot; Dr. Grogan said. &quot;In a reverse total shoulder replacement, the orientation is just the opposite. We fix a round surface onto the existing socket in the shoulder blade and place a socket into the top of the humerus. This change improves the mechanics of the shoulder and puts the powerful deltoid muscle at a relative advantage.&quot;</p><p>Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has been performed in the U.S. since 2003, but many orthopedic surgeons who have been practicing for more than two decades were not trained to perform this procedure.</p><h3>Dr. Grogan: &#39;The guy&#39;</h3><p> John did his homework before scheduling surgery and the consensus from those he trusted was clear: Dr. Grogan was &quot;the guy&quot; in south central Wisconsin to perform a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.</p><p>&quot;He had strong credentials, and just as important, I felt very comfortable with him personally,&quot; said John. &quot;Nice guy. Smart guy.&quot;</p><p>John is also a pretty smart guy, saying something that would be music to the ears of any physical therapist.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;ve got to be a major participant in your recovery and really commit to PT,&quot; John said. &quot;Guess who loses if you aren&#39;t? Me! Guess who wins if you are? Me!&quot;</p><p>After meeting with Dr. Grogan, John felt his prospects for pain relief and greater range of motion were excellent, and the operation was scheduled at <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-health-at-the-american-center/45863\">East Madison Hospital</a>.</p><p>&quot;My favorite person in the operating room is the anesthesiologist,&quot; John said. &quot;My last words to him were, &#39;I don&#39;t want to feel nothing!&#39; &quot;</p><h3>Immediate pain relief</h3><p>After spending just one night in the hospital, John was amazed beyond words.</p><p>&quot;The shoulder pain that prompted the surgery almost vanished overnight,&quot; he said. &quot;On a 10-point scale, it went from a 9 before surgery to a 1 or 2 the next day. There was some pain for a few days, but that was more because of soft tissue being cut in surgery so Dr. Grogan could reach the right places.&quot;</p><p>As for John&#39;s arm, which he could barely raise above a 45-degree angle, he was proudly raising it nearly straight up within three months of the operation.</p><p>As he vowed, John has diligently stuck to his PT regimen for the past several months, attending clinic appointments weekly and doing his at-home exercises daily. He can&#39;t wait to get back on the golf course, but he knows that day will come soon enough.</p><p>While all is going smoothly to date with the shoulder, John probably has another orthopedic joint replacement - a knee - in his near future.</p><p>&quot;They told me four years ago that I had one messed up knee,&quot; John said.</p><p>Once he gets past the knee surgery, John hopes to put his sales skills to work by raising money for a non-profit organization. </p><p>For now, John is enjoying life at his Middleton home with his wife, Joanne, and occasional crosstown visits from his grown daughter and her family, including John&#39;s irresistible 7-month-old granddaughter, Stella James. In addition to his daughter (Stella&#39;s mom), John has two grown sons who reside in Fairfax, Va.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Jay Wilson underwent a total hip replacement, performed by Brian T. Nickel, MD. Here is his story.\n\n</p><p>When hip pain prevented WISC-TV Sports Director Jay Wilson from covering the Badger football team from the sideline, he sought treatment from a UW Health orthopedic surgeon specializing in minimally invasive total hip replacement. Just six weeks after surgery, Jay was back on the news and enjoying his active lifestyle pain free.</p><h3>When hip pain puts you on the injury report</h3><p>A Wisconsin Rapids native and Madison resident, Jay has covered athletes from the sidelines for over 38 years as an anchor, reporter, and most recently, as sports director for WISC-TV. In addition to his physically demanding career, golfing, family time, lawn care and basketball keep him busy.</p><p>For the past 25 years, Jay and a group of friends have played basketball at the Camp Randall Memorial Sports Center. In January 2018, Jay’s right hip began bothering him.</p><p>“I thought it was a groin injury,” he said. “I saw my primary doctor, who took x-rays that showed my cartilage was gone and my hip bone was grinding.”</p><p>Not quite ready for surgery, Jay exhausted all other measures before making an appointment with an UW Health orthopedic surgeon. Despite attempts to control his pain with physical therapy, oral anti-inflammatories and a steroid injection, Jay said, “I could feel my hip was out of joint because it clicked and moved. If I sat for any length of time it took a good 20-25 seconds to get going again.”</p><h3>Choosing an expert</h3><p>Knowing UW Health’s reputation for innovation and patient care, Jay scheduled his surgery for December 2018. But his increasing pain and decreasing mobility sent him to East Madison Hospital two months early to meet hip and knee surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10918</span>, MD. Jay chose Dr. Nickel because of his extensive experience with minimally invasive robotically assisted total hip replacement.</p><p>Dr. Nickel said, “Mr. Wilson’s experience is a textbook example of the algorithm for treating osteoarthritis. Despite our best efforts to treat him nonoperatively with physical therapy, oral anti-inflammatories and injections, his joint destruction was too great to overcome without surgery. “His joint pain profoundly impacted his lifestyle, personally and in the workplace, and his ability to sleep, making the decision to move forward with surgery much easier.”</p><p>After meeting with Dr. Nickel, Jay decided that total hip replacement was the only option to regain his active lifestyle. He moved up his surgery to the end of October. “I couldn’t imagine waiting until December,” he said.</p><p>After surgery, Jay was transferred to a hospital bed where he settled in for an overnight stay.</p><p>Just hours after surgery, he tweeted, “Medical update. Surgery complete. New hip in place. Went great. Anesthesia starting to wear off but I can tell it’s fixed.” By evening, he had been up walking twice between episodes of “The Andy Griffith Show.” When Dr. Nickel visited him the next morning, he’d walked two flights of stairs and was ready to go home.</p><h3>Road to recovery</h3><p>After discharge, Jay returned home with a list of stretches and exercises. By day two, he stopped using a walker and transitioned to a cane for support. By day five, he was out and about in public with his cane. By Day 13, he walked into UW Health at Research Park to meet with his physical therapist, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10994</span>, without any assistance.</p><p>“Jay’s made incredible progress,” said Miller. “Each PT session focuses on Jay’s rehab progress and return to optimal function. We want to get Jay, and every patient, back to their normal routines without pushing too far too fast.”</p><p>Jay summarized his first two weeks after surgery: “I knew I made the right decision right away. The pain I had for eight months is completely gone. Going up and down stairs is so much easier. My leg feels strong and stable - so much better than it was.”</p><h3>Overall impression of total hip replacement surgery</h3><p>Jay met with Dr. Nickel for a follow up appointment two weeks after his procedure. Since the surgery, he’s sleeping better, exercising regularly and even started shooting free throws – all without pain.</p><p>At his six-week follow up appointment, when asked what surprised him most about this journey, Jay said, “I didn’t think I’d feel this good, this fast. It’s remarkable.”</p><h3>About the procedure</h3><p>In the operating room, Dr. Nickel and a team of surgical experts replaced Jay’s hip. The diseased parts of his right hip joint were removed and replaced with artificial parts – a titanium cup with a plastic liner to replace the hip socket, a ceramic ball to replace the femoral head, and a titanium femoral stem to connect the hip to the leg.</p><p>Dr. Nickel said, “A total hip replacement means we replace both the ball and the socket. With extreme precision, we remove the worn-out cartilage and bone and reconstruct the joint to restore the native anatomy.”</p><p>Jay’s CAT scan was used to construct a computerized 3-D model and individualized surgical plan. During the procedure, a surgical robotic was calibrated and synced with the plan. The robotic arm helps the surgeon position the hip implant, confirming perfect placement.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Julie Weiss was 41 when she started to feel something wasn’t right. By the time her symptoms fully took hold, she was downright miserable. </p><p>She was nauseous every day and vomited frequently. She was exhausted from not sleeping well.</p><p>The symptoms became so persistent that she became depressed. On some nights, this sweet wife and mother from Wisconsin Dells, Wis., wasn&#39;t even sure if she wanted to get out of bed the next morning. This was life as Julie knew it, for seven years.</p><p>&quot;It was really hard,” Julie said. “I felt like I had stomach flu every day. I also had bad heartburn and body aches. When the vomiting wouldn’t stop, I went on a liquid diet for days at a time to be sure I got enough nutrients, since solid food would not stay down.&quot;</p><p>Julie got some answers, but she still didn’t know the underlying cause of her misery. First, she was diagnosed with an esophageal ulcer. Later, doctors told Julie she had gastroparesis, a condition in which normal stomach contractions slow down or stop, essentially bringing the digestive system to a halt.</p><h3>High calcium level was a red flag</h3><p>Julie suffered for years with these symptoms until a routine physical exam with her obstetrician/gynecologist signaled a potential solution.</p><p>&quot;Your calcium level is elevated,” said Julie’s gynecology nurse practitioner, Maria Wolf, APNP, with Mile Bluff Medical Center in Mauston, Wis. “I want you to see your primary care doctor and have more testing done.&quot;</p><p>At long last, the code of Julie’s agony was cracked. Much to her surprise, Julie was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands – each person has four – becomes overactive and secretes excess parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood and ultimately to the patient’s misery. The only cure for hyperparathyroidism is surgical removal of the overgrown parathyroid gland, located in the neck.</p><p>Accordingly, Julie’s primary care doctor, Ann Hoffmann, MD, in Mauston, referred Julie to UW Health endocrine surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8885</span>, MD.</p><p>“Dr. Schneider showed me my bad parathyroid gland on the ultrasound and we scheduled surgery for three weeks later,” Julie said.</p><p>Performed on an outpatient basis, the parathyroid surgery is typically done under general anesthesia, lasting about an hour.</p><p>&quot;About 80 percent of patients have only one overactive parathyroid,&quot; Dr. Schneider said. &quot;However, even if we think only one gland is causing the problem, we keep each patient in the operating room until we confirm that the remaining parathyroid glands are normal. We actually measure the patient&#39;s parathyroid hormone level in the O.R. and, if necessary, remove more tissue until we see a steep drop in the hormone level. Like most patients, Julie needed only one parathyroid gland removed.”</p><h3>An amazing, virtually instant improvement</h3><p>The morning after surgery, Julie experienced nothing short of pure joy.</p><p>“For the first time in years,” she said, “I didn’t feel like I had to throw up.”</p><p>The next morning, however, Julie felt a strange sensation in her stomach. After a moment or two, she realized that things were actually just fine.</p><p>“My stomach was growling again!” she remembers shouting to her husband Raymond. “It was working.&quot; Everything else was working normally too, and today Julie is symptom-free.</p><p>Life was good again – not only for Julie but for Raymond, and their three children: Alyssa, 21; Andrew, 18; and Elizabeth, 15.</p><p>“One of the greatest things about this surgery is being able to have fun with the kids again,” Julie said. “So many of my youngest daughter’s memories of me are of her mother feeling sick, so being able to start making better family memories was such a gift.&quot;</p><p>Julie also can’t say enough about UW Health’s Endocrine Surgery care team, located at <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L280</span>.</p><p>“Dr. Schneider is so kind and caring, and the nurses were unbelievable,&quot; Julie said. &quot;I would give everyone I met a 10 out of 10.”</p><p>“It’s unfortunate that hyperparathyroidism is frequently underdiagnosed,” Dr. Schneider said. “Many people like Julie suffer way too long because the dots are not being connected or patients assume their symptoms are age-related. If you are struggling without an answer, we suggest having your calcium levels checked. It could lead to getting your life back, the way it did for Julie.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Seven years after her last strabismus surgery, Veronica Blumer once again finds herself in the eye clinic. But this time around, it’s for a much different reason.</p><p>The 22-year-old from Monticello, Wis., has been in-and-out of hospitals, operating rooms and various clinics since birth.\n\r\n“I was born two months early and had a brain bleed that caused hydrocephalus, which is a buildup of fluid on the brain,” Blumer said. “I’ve had several surgeries on my brain to correct the issue throughout my lifetime, but it put a lot of pressure on my eyes and I developed double vision when I was 6.”\n\r</p><div></div><p>\n</p><p>In 2007, Blumer’s vision issues brought her under the care of UW Health pediatric ophthalmologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5569</span>, MD, who observed not only the double vision but diagnosed bilateral superior oblique palsy, which can be associated with hydrocephalus.\n\r\n“She was trying to compensate for her double vision in downgaze by adopting a chin-down position to move her eyes up,” Bradfield said. “As a young child starting to read, that’s an extremely difficult issue to be dealing with.”\n\r\nTo correct the vision issues, Bradfield performed a complex strabismus surgery on Blumer to properly align her eyes. The procedure was successful in treating the double vision, and another surgery was performed 10 years later to maintain Blumer’s eye alignment.\n\r\nThroughout those 10 years – and the many follow-up appointments during that time – both Blumer and her family developed a close relationship with Bradfield and a friendship developed. At one point, the Blumer family even learned what kind of coffee drink Bradfield liked best and made sure to hit up Starbucks prior to appointments.\n\r\n“We always brought her cinnamon dolce lattes every time we came to the clinic,” Blumer said. “After my first surgery, we took a picture together, and she still has the picture to this day, which is really sweet.”\n\r\nSince her last surgery in 2017, Blumer says her vision is now “pretty much perfect,” but plenty else has also changed in her life, including graduating from both high school and college, and recently landing her first job out of school.\n\r\nWhich is exactly why Blumer is back once again at the eye clinic: She’s now employed as a medical scheduler at UW Health’s University Station clinic, working alongside the staff that once treated her as a patient.\n\r\n“I always knew I wanted to do something with medicine,” Blumer said, “and it’s always been my dream to work for UW Health. Ever since I was little, I wanted to work here.”\n\r\nSo when a recent opportunity arose to work a rotation in the pediatric clinic and see Bradfield again – this time as a colleague – Blumer jumped at the opportunity.\n\r\n“I had tears in my eyes when I saw her,” she said. “And we got to take another picture together, which was just so cool.”\n\r\nAs for Bradfield, she says that she’s immensely proud of Blumer and is thrilled to watch her former patient find success in her personal and professional life.</p><p>“One of the rewards of being a pediatric ophthalmologist is having that long-term continuity with patients and their families,” she said. “In Veronica’s case, the surgical intervention and subsequent care really allowed her to succeed in school, to be able to drive a car safely and now to have a career in health care. It’s pretty amazing.”\n\r\nAs a medical scheduler, Blumer is often the first point of contact with ophthalmology patients, both in-person and over the phone. Frequently, patients have questions or express feelings of stress and anxiety over an unresolved medical issue. But Blumer says she’s in a unique position to help these patients.\n\r\nAfter all, she’s been in their shoes.\n\r\n“My past experience here really helps in handling patients, because you have an idea of what they’re going through and when they’re scared,” Blumer said. “Because it can be a pretty scary thing. I understand that and I think it helps me better relate with people.”\n\r\nAnd while Blumer is happy to give back to patients in this way, she’s already looking ahead to how she can make an even bigger impact going forward.\n\r\n“I really want to go into health care social work and hopefully help with communication between patients, doctors and their teams, because this place, UW Health, has always been so amazing with my family,” she said. “I really want to help patients like they helped us.” \r\n\r\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>“Independence Day” will soon take on a whole new meaning for the Prust family of Watertown, Wisconsin. On July 3, 2022, one day before Independence Day, 4-year-old Violet, a cancer patient at UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital, will receive her final dose of chemotherapy, 27 months after being diagnosed with a form of childhood leukemia known as ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia).</p><p>Before looking ahead, however, let’s turn the clock back for a moment to late March 2020. COVID-19 has just hit. Remote work and schooling are just beginning to take hold while “shelter in place,” “flatten the curve” and “community spread” enter our vocabulary. For Violet’s parents, Korbyn and Brandon, the anxiety of trying to cope with a rapidly spreading pandemic is nothing compared to what is going on in their own home.\n\r\nOn March 24, 2020, Korbyn — who was in the hospital after delivering her second child, Ben — received a call from her mother, Trish, who was taking care of Violet. Suddenly and inexplicably, Violet, then age 2, was noticeably limping.\n\r\nKorbyn and Brandon returned home with their newborn the next day. Violet’s pediatrician told the Prusts to take Violet to the Emergency Department at American Family Children’s Hospital. Twelve hours and several tests later, everything appeared to be fine.\n\r\nThree weeks later, however, leukemia cells appeared in Violet’s blood. The diagnosis wasn’t yet certain, but signs clearly pointed toward cancer.\n\r\n“The nurse told us to come back to the hospital for one more blood test and pack a bag for a week,” Korbyn says. “I refused to believe the worst, so all we packed was a phone charger.”\n\r\nIndeed, the diagnosis was leukemia, and the Prusts were devastated. Korbyn barely knew what to do, having known only two people — an aunt and her husband’s grandmother — who had been touched by cancer.</p><h2>Difficult news, but an excellent prognosis</h2><p>\r“This was a whole new world for us,” Korbyn says. “Fortunately, the doctors told us that Violet had a better than 95-percent chance of being cured. So, we had a diagnosis, an excellent prognosis and an outstanding care team. It wouldn’t be easy moving ahead, but the reassurance of being in the right place meant everything.”\n\r\nCaring for a two-year-old child with cancer and a new baby, all while living with newly issued COVID-19 restrictions that prevented siblings and visitors from coming to the hospital, was very challenging.\n\r\nKorbyn and Violet moved into the childhood cancer unit at the hospital. Baby Ben went back to Watertown to live with Grandma Trish, while Brandon went back to work after using up his three weeks of parental leave. Grandma Trish even drove Ben from Watertown to Madison every day so Korbyn could breastfeed him.\n\r\n“We were struggling,” recalls Korbyn. “Violet felt miserable. She stopped eating and drinking, and then her limp turned into not walking at all for five months. I was also dealing with postpartum depression and COVID was isolating us from friends and family members who could have been helpful. It was a sad and scary time.”\n\r\nBecause Violet wouldn’t eat, she took her food, water and medications through a special tube inserted through her nose, down her throat and into her stomach.\n\r\n“The tube finally fell out nearly a year later, so the nurses told us to leave it out and see if she would eat on her own,” Korbyn says. “A few chicken nuggets and fries turned out to be Violet’s secret sauce, so at least she was eating on her own. Finally, we felt like she had a win.”</p><h2>\rCustom treatment provides hope; minimizes side effects</h2><p>\rOver the past two years, Violet received several rounds of in-hospital  chemotherapy infusions to kill cancer cells, combined with steroids that help the chemotherapy work better to destroy any remaining cancer cells. She also takes chemotherapy medication at home in pill form.\n\r\n“Most patients experience unpleasant side effects from chemotherapy and steroids, and children are no exception,” says Dr. Carol Diamond, Violet’s UW Health Kids oncologist and member of the UW Carbone Cancer Center. “Fortunately, childhood cancer research over the last 30 years enables us to customize treatments so we don’t give more medication than is necessary. Violet is among those who need fewer steroids than others, which not only takes less of a toll on her now but also reduces the severity of any potential side effects for her later in life.”\n\r\nChildren undergoing chemotherapy typically have a port placed in their chest that allows for easy vein access without endless needle pricks. To make it easier for her nurses to access Violet’s port, her Great Grandma Bev made an entire wardrobe for Violet of “port-friendly” shirts, dresses and sweaters in various sizes and colors.\n\r\n“Bev once had cancer herself, so she feels especially connected to Violet, who loves having so many clothing options,” Korbyn says. “Bev is truly an angel.”</p><h2>\r“Independence Day” will be bittersweet</h2><p>\rWith Violet’s last round of chemotherapy just a few months away, there is no shortage of gratitude Violet’s family expresses for their daughter’s care.\n\r\n“I’m looking forward to the end of treatment for many reasons,” Korbyn says, “but it will be hard not seeing everyone at American Family Children’s Hospital quite as often.”\n\r\nViolet loves her care team, including Dr. Diamond; Dr. (Christina) Amend (a pediatric cancer physician who is completing her training); Kari Weier, CPNP, a UW Health Kids nurse practitioner; Emily Gulczynski, RN; Carly Baumann, a Child Life specialist; and even Kiko, the children’s hospital’s therapy dog.\n\r\n“Finishing a child’s treatment is sometimes bittersweet for families,” Weier says. “That’s why kids like Violet still return for regular follow-up visits for a few years. Not only do we keep a close eye on the child’s physical health, but it also provides reassurance to families as they gradually loosen the ties with their care team.\r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Last fall, Sophie Beyer was only well enough to attend school one day per week.</b> Now, not only can she make it to school, but she’s also attending evening rehearsals for a community play four days a week. (She’s Brigitta in “The Sound of Music.”)</p><p>The big difference between then and now: Sophie found the Renal Autotransplant Program (RAP) at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, where she underwent a procedure that finally gave her some relief from her pain.\r\n\r\nSophie, 14, first began experiencing health problems in December 2020. Within a matter of weeks, she lost weight, suffered through leg pain and numbness and learned she had a cyst on her spinal cord. Physical and occupational therapy relieved some of that pain, but later she developed significant left-sided abdominal and flank pain. When her doctor ordered a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the radiologist found a serious problem: she had nutcracker syndrome.\r\n\r\nNutcracker syndrome is a rare vein compression disorder in which an artery in the abdomen squeezes the left renal vein and impairs the blood flow draining the kidney. This can cause many chronic problems, the worst being chronic left-side abdominal and flank pain. Sophie had experienced abdominal pain throughout her childhood, but her parents never dreamed that she had such a serious condition.\r\n\r\nThe Beyers live in Prescott, Wisconsin, which is right across the border from Minnesota and near the Twin Cities. They knew Sophie needed a vascular surgeon, but they couldn’t find anyone in the area who was willing to see a pediatric patient with nutcracker syndrome. Then, in a Facebook group for people with nutcracker syndrome, they heard about David Foley, MD, transplant surgeon at UW Health and director of the renal autotransplant program. \r\n\r\nSophie traveled to Madison to see Dr. Foley in August 2021. There, he ordered additional x-ray studies that confirmed the diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome, the likely cause of her unrelenting pain. The good news: Dr. Foley could fix it by performing a renal autotransplant. In November 2021, he completed the surgery during which he removed her left kidney and all the swollen veins around the kidney and placed the kidney on the right side of her abdomen. \r\n\r\n“This condition affects both children and adults. When we have a pediatric patient with nutcracker syndrome, the blood vessels are smaller, but it’s still the same standard operation,” says Dr. Foley. “We have had good success in helping pediatric patients, as well as adults, with this condition.”\r\n\r\nAnd if the Beyers have anything to do with it, more families will hear about UW Health’s success with renal autotransplant. They’ve already recommended the program to several other families they’ve met online. “We loved the doctors at UW Health, and we were so impressed with the care,” says Kelsey.\r\n\r\nSophie, meanwhile, still battles a few other health issues. But her flank pain has resolved, and she’s happy to be living a fuller life. “I don’t have any stomach pain anymore, and the headaches have gotten a lot better,” she says. “I’m doing a lot better than I was before.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>When Jenny and Tyler Hougom and their 3-year-old daughter Valerie welcomed baby Lucas to their world in August 2019, he appeared strong and healthy. </b>But within days, Lucas was diagnosed with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common virus that rarely causes problems in most healthy people but can cause hearing loss and neurologic issues in newborns.</p><p>For Lucas, it resulted in 10 days in their local NICU, where he received platelet transfusions and blue light therapy for his jaundice. But his blood count stabilized, and Jenny and Tyler finally took their baby home. </p><p>What followed was “what felt like a lifetime of blood draws and labs,” said Jenny. After six weeks, Lucas’ platelet counts remained stable, but his bilirubin level was not decreasing. “The team told us they had never seen CMV attack the liver,” said Jenny, “but they referred us to Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8601</span> at American Family Children’s Hospital, so off we went to Madison.” </p><p>Dr. Sigurdsson ruled out biliary atresia, a disease of the bile ducts, but Lucas continued to decline.</p><p>“That’s when we met Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11326</span>, and had our biggest, life-changing appointment,” said Jenny. </p><p>Dr. Furuya, pediatric transplant hepatologist and medical director of the pediatric liver transplant program, knew right away Lucas would most likely need a liver transplant.</p><p>“It’s very rare for congenital CMV to cause cirrhosis and liver failure in infancy,” said Dr. Furuya. “We provided supportive care, optimizing his condition, so he would be ready for liver transplant.” </p><h3>Race against the clock</h3><p>Most of November was a whirlwind.</p><p>Lucas was in the hospital for a week, then able to go home for a few days, and the cycle would repeat. The team worked to help Lucas gain weight and improve his eating. In early December, Lucas spiked a fever and was readmitted to Gundersen Hospital in La Crosse. He suffered a severe reaction to his medications and had a possible seizure. Lucas was transferred to AFCH for further management.  By mid-December, it was clear Lucas desperately needed a transplant. But at only 11 pounds, a liver transplant at this age, for this disease with active CMV, had not been reported.  </p><p>“We were very concerned about listing Lucas for transplant while he had CMV,” said <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5806</span>, MD, transplant surgeon and surgical director of pediatric liver transplant. “No other child in Wisconsin had ever been transplanted with active CMV.”</p><p>The team consulted with pediatric infectious disease specialist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5759</span>, MD, for help in controlling his active CMV disease as much as possible, prior to liver transplant.</p><p>“We were in uncharted territory, and everyone agreed that Lucas was a very unique case,” said Conway. </p><p>Lucas was listed for transplant, but donor livers from babies are very rare so the search began for a living liver donor. Lucas needed a very small donor who matched his blood type, which ruled-out many family members. The Hougoms posted a plea for a donor on Facebook. </p><p>Within two days, Lucas’ transplant nurse coordinator, Beth Gerndt-Spaith, had seen more than 100 potential donors step up. “Many of them were strangers,” said Jenny. “We couldn’t believe it. This surgery is a big deal, and we were so comforted by this response.” </p><p>Ultimately, none were good matches for Lucas. The family made plans for Christmas and prayed for a miracle. After the holidays, they posted another Facebook message and their miracle began. </p><h3>Long-distance hero</h3><p>A thousand miles away in North Carolina, Christina Wettstein received a message from her best friend from high school: <i>Did you see this about Jenny’s baby?</i> </p><p>Christina and Jenny, who grew up in Onalaska, were friends in high school but hadn’t connected since early college. “I thought to myself, &#39;I’m the right size, I might be able to do this,&#39; &quot; said Christina.</p><p>But first, she needed to learn her blood type. Her husband Alex is a Marine who was deployed in Norway, so Christina went to the military base hospital.</p><p>“I told the corpsman why I needed to know my blood type, and that I hoped it was O so I could maybe donate part of my liver to save my friend’s baby,” said Christina. “After the test, he was so excited, even teared up, yelling, ‘You have O blood!&#39; &quot;</p><p>Christina called Alex to tell him she was the right size and blood type. “You&#39;ve gotta do this,” he said. </p><p>“I filled out the form to be a donor,” said Christina, “and messaged Jenny: <i>I’m going to come and get screened. They feel good about my chances of being the donor</i>.”</p><p>Stepping out of Lucas’ hospital room to read the message, Jenny was overwhelmed. </p><p>“She’s in North Carolina, her husband is in Norway and she has a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old and she’s coming to Wisconsin,” said Jenny. “The fact that someone would do something like that was more than I could imagine. I just reminded her not to feel obligated.”</p><p>Within 48 hours, on Dec. 26, Christina had booked a flight and arranged for her parents to come from Florida to North Carolina to care for her kids. “My parents left a holiday party to drive 13 hours to my home,” said Christina. “I couldn’t have done any of this without their support.”</p><p>Christina’s support team expanded when her friend flew in from Minneapolis to be with her through the testing. While Christina went through a thorough evaluation process, her parents drove her kids to Wisconsin. </p><p>“The team did a really great job educating me about the entire process,” said Christina. “They told me about how serious of an operation it is and made me think long and hard about my decision.” </p><p>Christina’s main concern was for her children. “I kept thinking, &#39;What if I can’t hold them?&#39; &quot;</p><p>But Christina believes that everything happens as it should. </p><p>“I was at peace,” she said. “I knew that anything that I needed, someone would be there for us.” </p><p>After her evaluation, Christina learned that her liver was likely too large, and the team was reviewing another donor. She took her kids to Culver’s and tried to get over her disappointment. </p><p>“We’re sitting there having a normal family discussion and I get a call from UW Health saying they were going to try to do the transplant,” said Christina. “I was being a mom, cleaning up the milk my daughter spilled, when I learned that I as going to be Lucas’ liver donor. There’s something so right about that scene.&quot;</p><p>After her final clinic appointment, for the first time in 10 years, Jenny, Christina and Tyler met to discuss the situation and share their hopes that all would go smoothly. Lucas’s was in dire need of a transplant, and surgery was scheduled for the next week, on Monday, Jan. 13, 2020. </p><h3>All systems go</h3><p>The day before his surgery, the Hougoms enjoyed a nice Sunday together. They ordered a pizza, shared stories and snuggled with Lucas. Typically, one of them would go home for the evening but that night they both decided to stay at the hospital. A few hours before his surgery, Tyler noticed Lucas was stirring. Lucas started coughing and vomiting blood. </p><p>“I ran into the hallway screaming for help,” said Jenny. The PICU team arrived and they saw Lucas was bleeding from his bottom, too. Lucas was losing blood quickly. He was intubated and the team pumped blood and plasma for two hours working to stabilize him enough for surgery.</p><p>“I remember Dr. D’Alessandro saying, ‘He’s very sick,’ and that they would do their best, but we should prepare ourselves and go tell Lucas we loved him,&quot; said Jenny. “We appreciated his honesty and we knew there was no guarantee that Lucas would survive. We also knew he was a fighter.&quot;</p><p>Lucas underwent vascular shunt surgery to help stabilize him from the massive bleeding. “Lucas’ liver was rock hard, and that caused the blood to go everywhere but through his liver,” said Jenny. </p><p>Because of the extensive bleeding, CT scans were performed to see if Lucas had bleeding to the brain. There was some blood by the base of his neck, but none inside the brain. “The team told us that we needed a scan without any brain bleeds before we could consider transplant,” said Jenny. </p><p>The Hougoms waited and watched their tiny, 5-month-old son battle on. </p><h3>Waiting for action</h3><p>Meanwhile, in her own room at University Hospital, Christina waited anxiously to learn if the transplant was happening. She had arrived 24 hours earlier, thinking the surgery would begin in the morning. Alex had received emergency leave and made the (what turned into a 55-hour) trek from Norway. He had little time remaining to spend with Christina before he had to return, so they were extra anxious about the delay. </p><p>“When my surgeon, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10680</span>, came in to my room,” said Christina, “he told me Lucas wasn’t doing well. I begged him to take my liver to save him.” </p><p>While the team worked to save Lucas, Christina had a good cry and then called her grandmother, who prayed with her. </p><p>“I remember him saying, ‘This is a holding pattern,’ and he helped me so much. I just kept watching the clock … tick, tick, tick … thinking, ‘I have to do this. He has to get my liver.&#39; I will never forget nurse Allison, who went through all my emotions with me and gave me so much love.”</p><p>After learning Lucas had pulled through shunt surgery and that the team was hoping to do the transplant the next day, Christina was happy. And hungry. “I was so happy Lucas had made it,” said Christina, “and also that I could eat.”</p><h3>Back to the OR</h3><p>Lucas was prepped for surgery. The team had to make sure none of his other organs were injured and then decide if the transplant would proceed. </p><p>“It was good news, wait, good news, wait,” said Tyler. “We were exhausted, but hopeful.”</p><p>Christina waited in her room, hungry again, but hopeful. Suddenly, there were six people in the room and she was off to surgery. </p><p>“I was so happy,” said Christina. “Next to having my kids, this was the best moment of my life. I had no fear or worry. There was just something there telling me do this for Lucas. There’s something special about that kid.&quot;</p><p>In another area of the hospital, Jenny got a text from Alex: &quot;<i>We’re a go for donation!&quot;</i></p><p>Later that evening, the family learned that both Lucas and Christina were doing well. </p><p>“They showed us a picture of Lucas’ old liver compared to his new liver,” said Tyler. “It looked like a big, black rock.” </p><h3>The road to recovery</h3><p>It was 11 long days before Jenny and Tyler could hold Lucas. His CMV levels were undetectable a few weeks after transplant, but he remained in the PICU for six weeks.</p><p>“It was a long road,” said Tyler, “but easier to manage when you can look forward to things getting better.”</p><p>“The care Lucas received was amazing,” said Jenny. “I will never, ever have more appreciation for a team than what I saw on Jan. 13, and that level of care continued throughout his rehab. They cared for him like he was their son.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Christina was recovering at University Hospital, where, she said, “the team was incredible.” </p><p>When she left the ICU, Alex returned to Norway, comfortable knowing Christina and Lucas were doing well and in good hands.</p><p>“I appreciated that throughout the entire situation, I was a separate patient from Lucas,” said Christina. “They really cared about my situation and my health and went above and beyond to care for me, support me and be helpful. I had all the attention I needed to feel calm and comfortable.” </p><p>A week after surgery, Christina left the hospital to recover under the watchful eyes of her in-laws at their home in La Crosse.</p><p>“They were so supportive during recovery,” said Christina. “I really had to rely on people and was so grateful to stay with them for six weeks.” It was wonderful how they and my sister cared for me and kept our kids happy.” </p><p>Lucas left the hospital just as the COVID-19 lockdown started, to go to the home he hadn’t seen in 100 days. Except for a few short admissions, Lucas continued to thrive and by July, he had his first real bath since he was a newborn.</p><p>By his first birthday, he was tube-free and able to eat, drink and take his medications. Now he’s crawling, pulling himself up on to the couch and catching up quickly. </p><p>“As much as our family’s been through - and I wouldn’t wish this on anyone - but it’s bittersweet that every milestone he meets, we are just so proud of him,&quot; Jenny said. &quot;We don’t take anything for granted anymore. He made it through Jan. 13, he made it through all those CT scans, he made it through his transplant, and he just keeps surprising us with everything he does. He’s a very happy, independent little boy. Our gratitude is immeasurable.” </p><p>Christina returned to North Carolina with her daughters, where her friends and family continued to offer help. It was 12 weeks before she could carry her kids. “That was hard, but by six months, I felt like my usual full-strength mom,” she said. “The kids ask about my scar, but they love to Facetime with Lucas and Val for their birthdays.”</p><p>“It’s hard to wrap my head around what happened, what could have happened, that the surgeons were able to make this amazing miracle happen, and everything turned out the way it was supposed to,” said Christina. “I encourage other people to consider donating. We’re given a million chances a day to improve the world, and I’m really grateful I had this opportunity.”</p>",

She credits UW Health pediatric surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8229</span>, MD, with being the first doctor to take her concerns seriously.</p><p>“Ben just didn’t look right to me,” Nichol said. “He had some unusual facial features that indicated something genetic might be going on.”\r</p><p>Mary was incredibly relieved. Finally, she thought, a doctor was asking the right questions and listening intently as Mary described what was going on with her son.\r</p><p>Nichol’s testing confirmed that Ben was experiencing reflux from his stomach up to his airway. He was also aspirating, causing chronic problems with his lungs. Anti-reflux surgery, also known as Nissen fundoplication, would be needed to correct this problem. \r</p><p>During the operation, which Nichol has performed more than 100 times, he wraps the top 10 percent of the stomach around the lower five percent of the esophagus, creating a valve to stop the backflow of stomach acid into the airway. Nichol’s next step was sending Mary and Ben to Dr. <a href=\"https://www.waisman.wisc.edu/staff/rice-gregory/\">Greg Rice</a>, a UW Health pediatric geneticist located at the UW’s Waisman Center, just across from American Family Children’s Hospital.\r</p><h3>Genetic test at age one reveals highly rare condition\r</h3><p>In 2012, not long after Ben’s first birthday, Rice conducted chromosomal micro-array testing – the standard at the time – revealing the culprit. Ben’s genetic code, which governs everything from breathing to eye color, was missing one of the usual two copies of a gene known as NKX2-1, which normally lies on the 14th chromosome. This genetic abnormality, known as Chromosome 14q Deletion, is extraordinarily rare; only about 10 cases about this condition have been published in the medical literature.</p><p>“You can think of a chromosome like a necklace with hundreds of pearls that each represent one gene,” said Dr. Rice. “We don’t know every gene’s purpose, but we know that Ben’s lack of a copy of this important gene explained much of what was going on. His condition is sometimes called brain, lung and thyroid syndrome because it severely impacts a child’s cognitive development, pulmonary system and physical growth. It also makes a child very prone to respiratory and sinus infections, and Ben has had many of them.”\r</p><p>As devastating as the news was for Mary, her husband Rick and their four other children, she was grateful to finally have a diagnosis for her son.</p><p>“We had a million new questions,&quot; she said, &quot;but at least we had a name for it.&quot;</p><p>Soon, Ben became a “frequent flier” patient at American Family Children’s Hospital, with care coming from specialists not only in genetics, but also immunology (due to his susceptibility to infection), pulmonology, endocrinology and neurosurgery. Helping coordinate Ben’s specialty care from within the hospital is AFCH’s <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 5fCUmiCwBB8LrxWabf3iY6</span>.</p><p>“We also serve as a first contact point for families, so they don’t have to contact more than one specialist when they’re unsure which doctor to call first about their child,” said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9406</span>, who co-founded the Complex Care program in 2014.</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7467</span>, a pediatric immunologist who sees many complex patients, said that children like Ben do best when the family advocates forcefully while being willing to tolerate ambiguity.</p><p>“Caring for children like Benny means dealing with many shades of grey, because the body of knowledge about his condition is not that large,” said Seroogy. “Definitive answers are often hard to come by. As an immunologist, it’s my role to monitor Benny carefully to minimize risk for infection.”</p><p>Seroogy said Mary is one of the most dedicated parents she has met.</p><p>“She is so engaged with the care team and her love for Benny flows so freely. This makes our job so much easier.”</p><div></div><h3>A laugh, a hug or a twinkle in the eye\r</h3><p>Nothing about Ben – cognitive or physical – has escaped being impacted by his genetic condition. Among his deficits is speech, so he expresses himself nonverbally. Sometimes it’s a laugh or a hug; other times, it’s a glowing twinkle in his eye.</p><p>“When he’s happy, he giggles a lot,” said Mary. “He also loves having people around, so if he is left alone for too long, he might pound his fist. As a parent, you become very familiar with his nonverbal cues and body language.”\r</p><p>A fifth-grade student at Elvehjem Elementary School on Madison’s east side, Ben has a special education assistant (SEA) by his side at all times.\r</p><p>“The SEA has to be within arms’ reach of Ben at all times,” Mary said. “This person helps him in and out of his wheelchair, tends to his needs and keeps him safe. Sometimes, my little ‘Evel Knievel’ likes to rock in his wheelchair. He also has to be kept away from stairs to prevent falls.”\r</p><p>Many of Ben’s classmates are eager to help however they can. All Ben has to do is hit his large “Big Mack” switch button, audibly signaling that he needs something, and a friend is at the ready.</p><h3>Friends and teachers are wonderful</h3><p>“When Ben started school, I was afraid he would be left alone in the corner,” Mary said. “It has been anything but that, and many of his friends understand how important it is to stand up to bullies who might pick on a kid like Ben. Most of the kids and staff just adore him. We have been very lucky.”</p><p>Looking back, Mary feels nothing but gratitude to have a son like Ben. After 18 surgeries, several bouts of pneumonia and other respiratory infections, life is a bit less hectic now that Ben spends far less time in the hospital and more time at parks, beaches and the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison. None of these fun activities would happen today without the attentive ear of a UW Health pediatric surgeon nine years ago.\r</p><p>“I will always credit Dr. Nichol for saving his life by taking me seriously and getting Ben on the right track,” Mary said. “Kiddos like him teach you not to mind life’s little irritations or take a minute for granted. You enjoy every cuddle, every giggle and every hug. We are very blessed.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Jeff and Jennifer Livingston are a good team.</b> As they share the remarkable story of Jeff’s heart issues, his life-threatening infection and the surgery that saved him, the stroke that occurred during that surgery, and the resulting heart and kidney transplants that gave him a second chance at life, they take on two distinctive roles: Jennifer is the details person, and Jeff provides the color commentary. She is meticulous about all the steps he has taken to get better, while he makes brutally honest remarks about how little he was aware of his situation when he was in the most dangerous stage of his illness.</p><p>Jeff suffers from aphasia, a loss in ability to articulate words resulting from his stroke. So, Jennifer often must act as interpreter, filling in the blanks when Jeff struggles to find the right words. There’s one point on which they’re both clear, however: Jeff found the care and answers he was looking for at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. “Everyone who walked into my room knew exactly what happened to me, and they took such good care of me,” he says.\n\r\nIn 2012, Jeff underwent replacement of his aortic valve and aortic root (the blood vessel between his heart and the major artery supplying blood to his body) due to a narrowing of his aortic valve and associated enlargement of his aortic root. The surgery was a success, but he started experiencing mysterious symptoms in December 2020—difficulty walking at times and severe pain in the pelvic area. The symptoms came and went, and Jeff saw a wide variety of specialists, including a neurologist, an orthopedic surgeon and a gastroenterologist. \r\n\r\nIn summer 2021, Jeff’s problems came to a head: He lost consciousness and was admitted to his local hospital on June 25 with complaints of fever and chills. His doctors determined his problems were because of an infection in the aortic valve and root he had received nine years prior. They transported him to University Hospital, where doctors scheduled him for additional tests to determine the best way to treat him.\r\n\r\nDuring the evaluation, the doctors’ worst suspicions turned out to be true: Jeff’s heart was too damaged to reconstruct, so they had to install a total artificial heart—a temporary measure until Jeff was able to receive the gift of life with a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nAfter the surgery, Jeff breathed with the assistance of a tracheostomy tube, which was inserted through a hole in his windpipe. As a result, he couldn’t talk for several weeks … which was why Jennifer and his doctors didn’t know he had suffered a stroke. They suspect it happened during the surgery.   \r\n\r\nFor the next four months, the couple lived in the hospital—Jeff literally and Jennifer figuratively. She moved herself and their dog into her mother’s house in McFarland, Wisconsin, and spent all day, every day, working remotely from her laptop in Jeff’s hospital room (she is a paralegal). “During our time in the hospital, I was extremely impressed with everyone—from the cardiologists to the cleaning staff,” Jennifer says.\r\n\r\n“Working with Jeff and Jennifer has been so rewarding,” says Jennifer Brennan, Jeff’s nurse transplant coordinator. “They are a great team, and Jeff’s resilience inspires me.” \r\n\r\nDuring that time, Jeff went on dialysis because his kidney was functioning at a very low level. Ultimately, his doctors at UW Health put him on the transplant wait list for both a heart and a kidney. He received his new heart on Oct. 25 and his new kidney on Oct. 26—just seven days after he got on the wait list. By November, he was back home in Beloit, Wisconsin, continuing the long road to recovery.\r\n\r\n&quot;This is an important therapy for patients who have extensive cardiac disease and can&#39;t wait for a transplant,” says Jason Smith, MD, surgical director of heart transplant and one of Jeff’s artificial heart and transplant surgeons. “Jeff and Jennifer deserve a lot of credit for agreeing to be one of the first patients to undergo this procedure at the University of Wisconsin, and for having the perseverance to see a long course through to a great transplant.&quot;\r\n\r\nNow, Jeff spends his days undergoing therapy and commuting back and forth between Beloit and Madison so he can see his cardiologists, neurologist and nephrologist, and all the other specialists who are committed to seeing him improve. “I feel like I’m doing horribly, but when I talk to people, they tell me I’m doing great,” he says. \r\n\r\nJennifer agrees with them. “He’s doing fantastic physically,” she says. “He can walk the dog with me for 30 minutes at a time, and mentally, he’s doing a lot better.”\r\n\r\n“Jeff’s recovery from a life-threatening condition is a testament to the teams from multiple disciplines who defined the best treatment plan and worked together to achieve this successful outcome,” says Dr. Maryl Johnson, one of Jeff’s cardiologists. “The way that Jeff and Jennifer partnered with us to assure his recovery was essential.” \r\n\r\n“It was a long, hard road for both Jeff and Jennifer,” says Amy Fiedler, MD, Jeff’s cardiothoracic surgeon. “When Jeff arrived at the hospital, there were a lot of unknowns. It has been incredibly gratifying to see Jeff make such a remarkable recovery from both the total artificial heart and the combined heart/kidney transplant. It was also quite fun getting to know both Jeff and Jennifer through their lengthy inpatient hospitalization. We are so happy to have been able to provide the gift of life for the Livingstons.”\r\n\r\nThe Livingstons don’t yet know whether Jeff will be able to return to his job as a lawyer or his favorite hobbies of golf, bowling and softball. But they do know that whatever happens, they will be doing it together.\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>As far as Irina Shpigelman is concerned, her kidneys have always been community property in her marriage.</p><p>Her husband, Mike, was born with only one kidney, and about 10 years ago, that kidney’s function decreased to 13 percent. She told him that between the two of them, they had three kidneys, so they would be OK if he ever needed a transplant. Sure enough, the Madison couple saw another doctor who told them Mike would be on dialysis in a year if he didn’t receive a kidney transplant.\r \r\n\r\nSo, they began planning. The pair knew they had different blood types, but they also knew University Hospital in Madison offered a kidney exchange program. This program allows any healthy person over age 18 to donate a kidney in exchange for someone to receive a kidney from another living donor. Recently, the hospital began offering an advanced donation option in which the living donor can donate a kidney before his or her intended recipient needs a transplant, so that their intended recipient will receive a kidney when they’re ready for transplant. That was a perfect option for Irina and Mike, who have three young children and couldn’t afford for both to be out of commission for weeks. “That’s a huge blessing,” says Irina, “because we’re trying to keep life somewhat normal for our children.”\r \r\n\r\nIrina underwent her surgery on April 11, 2018. Shortly before donating her kidney, she happened to meet another living kidney donor through her church who had surgery just weeks before Irina. That woman became Irina’s confidante and supporter as Irina was undergoing her own recovery. Irina doesn’t know much about her recipient, but she has learned that it was a person who had difficulty finding a good match, so she’s grateful for the opportunity to help.\r \r\n\r\nMike hasn’t yet undergone his transplant — for the time being his kidney is still working, and he and Irina want to gain as much mileage as possible out of that kidney before replacing it.\r\n\r\n\r“I’m back to my normal life, so now I’m just concerned about Mike and his health,” says Irina. “We’re both very glad we were able to separate the two surgeries, so I can concentrate on him when his time for transplant comes.”</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>It was late May 2020 when Michael Smithback of Stoughton, Wis. suffered a traumatic fall near Baraboo, about 60 miles from home.</b> Sauk County Sheriff’s deputies and Baraboo Emergency Medical Service teams arrived on the scene only to find him completely unresponsive.\r\n</p><p><span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 24QydZQRxjb93rZIPz9prL</span> was called immediately to transport Michael to University Hospital in Madison but hopes for his survival were slim based on the severity of his condition.</p><p>“He was in a coma and didn’t respond to any verbal or physical cues,” said Michael’s wife, Nicole. “They got him to the hospital as fast as possible under the circumstances. The trauma and neuro teams were doing everything they could but were also preparing me by making it clear how severe his injuries were.”</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9863</span>, a UW Health neurosurgeon, was not optimistic.\r</p><p>“Michael had an incredibly severe brain injury known as a subdural hematoma with contusions,” Dr. Lake said. “His brain had shifted from the impact of the fall. There was also tremendous bleeding outside of the brain but inside the skull. Based on his unresponsiveness and what we could see on his CT scan, we told Nicole that most patients with an injury like this either don’t survive or become severely debilitated.”</p><h3>Nicole knew she might be a single mom\r</h3><p>Thoughts raced through Nicole’s head. Would she be a widow at age 40? How would their then-8-year-old daughter, Evelyn – Michael’s “mini-me” – adjust to life without her daddy?</p><p>And even if Michael somehow survived this horror, would his quality of life be such that he wouldn’t even be able to recognize the two greatest loves of his life?</p><p>Over the next 48 hours, Michael’s condition remained critical, but he was still alive. By the third day, things took a turn for the worse.\r</p><p>“He was awake at times during the day but he would become aggressive, confused and mean,” Nicole said. “He couldn’t follow basic directions and, when nursing staff asked him where he was, he didn’t know.”</p><p>CT imaging confirmed a sharp increase in swelling and bleeding, which explained the agitation and confusion.\r</p><p>“Michael’s brain hadn’t swelled that much during the first two days, but it really intensified on day three,” said Dr. Lake, who also identified damage to the temporal and frontal lobes of Michael’s brain. “This put him in serious trouble.”</p><p>There was only one option available to Dr. Lake to relieve the pressure on Michael’s brain: Operating immediately. Even still, there was no assurance that surgery would be enough to save him.</p><h3>Aggressive surgery was his only hope\r</h3><p>“It was his only chance,” said Dr. Lake. “We moved aggressively, taking him to surgery within two hours. We cut a large opening on top to relieve pressure from the rapid swelling and removed the damaged portion of the right temporal lobe. We also drained a blood clot that was pressing on the brain.”</p><p>Because there would be prolonged swelling, Dr. Lake did not fully close Michael’s skull. The large piece of Michael’s skull bone that was removed during surgery was placed into storage, where it stayed until Dr. Lake surgically restored it three months later – after the swelling had decreased and Michael’s condition had stabilized.</p><p>Dr. Lake was pleased with the initial surgery, but told Nicole that the extent of Michael’s recovery from that point would be up to him. It would soon be clear that Michael was just beginning to fight. \r</p><p>The next day, Dr. Lake was pleasantly surprised by a call he received from one of his colleagues.</p><p>“You won’t believe how well Michael is doing,” he told Dr. Lake. “He’s starting to follow basic commands.”\r</p><p>Michael also was doing well enough to have his breathing tube removed and start weaning off the ventilator. Dr. Lake agreed that things were improving, although doctors remained guarded about the situation.\r</p><h3>Two magical words from Michael\r</h3><p>Four days later, Nicole walked into Michael’s room in the Neuro-ICU and, much to her surprise, heard two words come out of her husband’s mouth: “Hi, babe!” \r</p><p>At that moment – which remains Michael’s first memory since the accident – the light began to emerge after five days in a very dark tunnel. \r</p><p>“That was when I realized I was in the hospital,” Michael said. “I could sense something not right with my head and I remember feeling like I was hit by a truck. But seeing my wife walk in the room was unforgettable.”\r</p><p>Nicole was ecstatic. Michael had clearly turned a corner, although it was just one step in a long journey.</p><p>“That was the day my thinking shifted from, ‘Will he survive?’ to ‘What kind of a life partner and daddy will he be?” she said. “Would he ever come home? Would my husband, at age 40, need to move into a nursing home or assisted living facility for the rest of his life?&quot;</p><p>Incredibly, Michael’s recovery began to take off, stunning not only his family but his UW Health care teams from neurosurgery and <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 2YksvFas0JAwaNDbAygZCT</span>. \r</p><p>After just nine days in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit, Michael was moved to a general care hospital room. Three days later, he was transferred from University Hospital to the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L286</span> on Madison’s far east side. He would spend just one week there, continuing his aggressive course of physical and occupational therapy.</p><h3>Home in 19 days\r</h3><p>On June 17, 2020 – just 19 days after suffering what seemed to be a possibly fatal head injury – Michael Smithback walked through the door of his own home.</p><p>Nicole, a healthcare administrator, was working full-time, so family members helped care for their daughter, who couldn’t venture out because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Home together for 14 weeks, Evelyn and her dad bonded in a way they never had before.</p><p>It wasn’t always easy, but Michael was “all in” with his rehab regimen.</p><p>“At first, Michael had trouble sorting out more than one task or conversation at a time,” said UW Health occupational therapist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10389</span>. “We worked on improving his ability to multi-task and his ability to process things visually, using lots of brain-building exercises. He gave 150 percent and we were able to dismiss him from occupational therapy after just a month. He was such a joy to work with.”\r</p><p>By Sept. 14 – Nicole’s birthday – Michael started to drive again, just 3½ months after the accident. Nine days later, he returned to work.</p><p>Looking back more than a year later, Michael and Nicole can’t find enough words to thank everyone involved in Michael’s incredible comeback.</p><p>“Despite the horror of the accident,” Nicole said, “so many things had to happen just right for Michael to be alive today. From his friends calling 911 immediately to the EMS response teams to the amazing care Michael received from Dr. Lake and his entire care team, there really aren’t words to capture our gratitude.”</p><p>Dr. Lake appreciates the kind words, but is quick to credit the extensive team of Neuro-Intensive Care Unit nurses, surgical nurses, floor nurses, rehabilitation therapists and others who played a critical role in Michael’s outcome.</p><p>“Michael’s recovery was due to many factors,” said Dr. Lake. “Fortunately, he got to the hospital quickly, thanks to the quick response of the EMS team and Med Flight. Second, we moved aggressively with surgery once his swelling and bleeding intensified. Third, was his excellent course of rehabilitation, but perhaps most important was Michael’s resilience, commitment to work hard and incredible family support. It’s wonderful to see somebody like Michael doing so well.”\r\n\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>John Boie was just 2 years old when he lost function of the lower part of his body after getting run over by a tractor on the family farm near Milton, Wis. </p><p>Although the injuries to his spinal cord left him physically confined to a wheelchair ever since — he is now 30 — John’s gritty determination and passion for life are infinitely more defining than his disability.\n\r\nSince he was a young teenager, John has dreamed of bringing home a gold medal as a member of the United States Men’s Wheelchair Basketball Team at the Paralympic games. In September 2021, that dream came true.\n\r\nJohn learned the game playing on multiple Wisconsin-based wheelchair basketball teams over the past 20 years, including the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks — one of the premier college wheelchair basketball programs in the nation for men and women.\n\r</p><h3>Urology team contributes to John’s success</h3><p>Helping John realize his dream is the UW Health urology team, which is part of the UW Health Specialty Clinic located at Fort HealthCare — just 10 miles from John’s home in Whitewater.\n\r\n“We’ve been caring for John for several years to help manage his bladder function, which was impaired by his spinal cord injury,” says Dr. Christopher Manakas, a UW Health urologist who is one of two urologists with a practice in Jefferson county.\n\r\n“Fortunately,” says Manakas, “we’ve been able to help John without having to perform any invasive procedures. Instead, he comes to us for periodic Botox injections that relax the bladder, allowing him to hold urine longer and avoid leaking. We also know how much the convenience of this clinic in Fort Atkinson means to patients like John, saving them from longer trips to Madison.”</p><h3>\rDr. Manakas one of John’s biggest fans</h3><p>While John’s USA team was playing in Tokyo for the gold medal, few people watching at home were as thrilled as Dr. Manakas.\n\r\n“I remember watching the game with my kids and after they won, there was John celebrating with his teammates,” Manakas says. “It was so cool, seeing my Fort Atkinson clinic patient on the other side of the world proudly hoisting the gold medal.”\n\r\nJohn’s Botox treatments — which are only needed once every 12-18 months — have substantially increased his quality of life, making daily life as well as his many basketball travels more manageable.\n\r\n“Helping me gain better control of my body has been instrumental,” John says. “Dr. Manakas has gone above and beyond the call repeatedly, and the clinic staff in Fort Atkinson is incredibly warm and welcoming. I never feel like a number.”</p><h3>\rPaying it forward as an academic advisor</h3><p>After earning a bachelor’s and master’s degree from UW-Whitewater, John has spent the past four years mentoring the next generation of students at his alma mater. As an academic advisor, John works with about 300 first-year students each year.\n\r\n“I especially enjoy helping first-generation college students who often come with no idea what to expect at a university,” John says. “They arrive with new independence, and we help put it to the best possible use by advising students about class selection, tutoring opportunities and basic living skills.”\n\r\nAt UW-Whitewater’s Academic Advising &amp; Exploration Center, John works beside his former UW-Whitewater men’s wheelchair basketball coach, Jeremy Lade, known across campus as “Opie.”\n\r\n“John has been a winner in basketball both at Whitewater and in the Paralympic games, which is fantastic,” Opie says, “Even better, John has been successful by applying his on-court lessons in life. On the court, he’s always willing to do whatever his team needs, and his selflessness remains one of his greatest qualities off the court.”\n\r\nOpie is proud of all John has accomplished but knows that John has more goals in mind, including another Paralympic team appearance at the 2024 games in Paris.\n\r\n“Mentoring John as his coach at Whitewater was a wonderful experience,” Opie says. “He came here with such a strong foundation and has shown so many others what it means to turn a weakness into a strength. He really is a rock star.”\r\n</p>",

For two months before surgery, I did the recommended exercises for knee replacement and added another 20 minutes of core exercises.\r\n\r\nAfter surgery, I followed the recovery plan exactly, stayed mobile and exercised. Voila! I can walk again! Up and down stairs and around the block like a normal person. I can carry more than 10 pounds again without my knee collapsing.\r\n\r\nHaving my knee replaced is the highlight of this century - so far. Good luck! And do your exercises.</p>",

      "story": "<p>By the time Greg Converse reached his late 50s, his active lifestyle – which included many bicycle rides, daily 5-mile runs and a vigorous weightlifting regimen -- had taken a hefty toll on Greg’s knees.</p><p>“I remember traveling to San Diego a few years ago and being in pain the whole time,” Greg says. “I was literally sweating and shaking from the pain.”</p><p>Following a referral from his primary doctor in 2018, Greg met with Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9313</span>, a UW Health Orthopedic Surgeon specializing in adult shoulder, hip, and knee surgery, who has performed more than 1,000 knee replacements in his career. It didn’t take long before Anderson confirmed that Greg had severe osteoarthritis. Bone was touching bone in both knees. </p><p>“Despite how bad my knees were, I was lucky I could still ride my bike without much discomfort, but even short walks became unbearable,” Greg says. “I am usually a very outgoing, positive person, but sometimes, I would just sit at home and cry – and I am not one to do pity parties. I knew it was time to do something.”</p><p>Although knee replacement surgery was clearly appropriate for Greg, Dr. Anderson typically discusses non-operative options with patients before recommending surgery. Unfortunately, the degeneration in Greg’s knees was highly advanced, leaving Greg with few if any non-surgical avenues.</p><p>“Just get it done,” Greg told himself</p><p>“I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life getting steroid injections and taking pain pills,” Greg says. “Ultimately, I might even lose my ability to walk, so I told myself it was time to just get the surgery done. To help with the post-surgery recovery, I decided to give myself a full body detox and lose about 15 pounds.”</p><p>Greg was scheduled to have his first knee replaced in March 2020, but a temporary halt to elective surgeries at the start of COVID-19 put Greg’s operation on hold for six months. When it got close to the day of surgery, Greg began preparing plenty of meals in advance, knowing that life would not be easy recovering from not one, but two knee replacements. (The first would be done September; the second in November.)</p><p>“I knew that recovery would be bumpy,” he says. “This was before the COVID vaccine, and I’d be cooped up alone in my apartment, having groceries delivered. I did not have a significant other to take care of me, so I’d focus on how much better I’d feel in a few months.” </p><p>Every day, Greg reminded himself that he’d be back on his bicycle by spring. The days of enjoying an active, pain-free life had vanished over the last few years, but he knew better days were not that far away.</p><h3>Spent three decades abroad</h3><p>Greg lived in Madison throughout his childhood and young adult years. When he was 25, he moved abroad, spending the next 30 years teaching English as a second language to students in five different countries. He returned to Madison in 2012 to care for his mother, who is still well and thriving at 95. </p><p>“I’ve lived in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong,” Greg says. “I love cooking ethnic – especially Asian – food, so I prepared many Asian meals before my surgeries that would be ready to heat up during my recovery.”</p><p>In addition to enjoying his own cooking, Greg found comfort in good music, TV comedies, movies and good books. His cousin Joy – also known as his “surgery guru” – helped keep Greg in good spirits through frequent phone conversations.</p><p>“It was hard, especially during pre-vaccine COVID, but I just put one foot in front of the other for my mental well-being,” Greg says. “Having never been through surgery or any serious medical situation before, I may not have been prepared for all of it, but I made a conscious choice not to complain or feel sorry for myself. I had been through worse times in my life, and I knew this was temporary.”</p><p>Today, Greg is nothing short of ecstatic. For that, he credits Anderson and his team.</p><p>“His bedside manner is so kind and friendly,” Greg says. “When we first met, Dr. Anderson immediately put me at ease and assured me he can fix my knees and straighten my legs, which had become bow-legged over time. He did exactly what he promised and now I call him my Miracle Man. And the nurses who cared for me were my angels.”</p><p>Greg also is grateful for his physical therapists, Isaac and Afton, who were extraordinarily adept at guiding him to full mobility while making each session fun.</p><p>“We laughed a lot, and I owe them all for bringing me back to a normal life,” Greg says. </p><p>Mindset also plays a large role in outcome, and Dr. Anderson credits Greg’s can-do attitude for much of the incredible progress he made in recovery. </p><p>“Greg’s positive mindset and intense motivation clearly played a big role in his excellent outcome,” Anderson says. “He took on the challenge very well. Meeting patients like Greg and having a part in getting them back to a better quality of life is an incredibly fulfilling part of this job. I&#39;m very grateful and privileged to be a part of their journey.&quot;\r</p>",

There were times when Zach was shaking so much, he could barely hang on to his chair.

Surgery was recommended, and it would not be a routine operation.\n\r</p><div></div><p>“It would be major surgery,” says Dr. Stadler, “but no matter how involved it is, we always want to do the smallest surgery necessary to do the job right. This provides the patient with a shorter recovery and less pain. We also want to spare the patient from any permanent loss of motion or function that could ensue from moving nearby muscles or ligaments around during the operation.”\n\r</p><h3>New robot made spine surgery more precise </h3><p>\rFortunately, the timing for Zach’s surgery was perfect, because American Family Children’s Hospital had recently acquired new technology – called the Mazor X Stealth Edition robotic guidance platform -- that allows surgeons like Dr. Stadler to perform extraordinarily precise spinal fusion surgery in very small spaces, such as the part of Zach’s spine where he would be operating. American Family Children’s Hospital was the first hospital in Wisconsin to obtain the Mazor X, and one of a handful of hospitals in the Midwest that have been using it.\n \r\n“Mazor X is a robotic technology that allows us to plan every step of the surgery before it starts. It not only helps us determine where every screw and rod will go but also the optimal and most precise pathway each screw will take before we drill it,” says Dr. Stadler.\n\r\nWithout the Mazor X, it would have been very challenging to precisely drill each screw into the small area of Zach’s spine where Dr. Stadler planned to operate.\n\r\n“This technology made a huge difference in Zach’s outcome,” says Dr. Stadler. “It ensured we could do -- with utmost precision – the smallest amount of surgery necessary to remove Zach’s tumor and improve his quality of life with minimal risk of complication.”\n\r\nJust three weeks after surgery, Zach resumed his physical therapy. He also was able to stop using prescription-strength pain relievers, needing only Tylenol by this point.\n\r</p><h3>Zach quickly bonded with Dr. Stadler</h3><p>“Like most people, the idea of surgery made Zach anxious, but this experience was, hands down, among the best hospital visits in his life,” says Jean. “He really likes Dr. Stadler, who connected with Zach right away, easing his anxieties and taking the time to answer his questions in great detail.”\n\r\nZach was told to expect a seven-day hospital stay, but things went better than expected when Dr. Stadler discovered that the tumor was merely pushing against – not attached to -- the spinal cord and nerves. This was very good news, and Zach went home just three days after surgery.\n\r\nBecause of his cerebral palsy, Zach uses a power wheelchair to get around, but occasionally uses a walker for shorter distances. In October 2020, he received his Eagle Scout rank and in June 2021, he graduates from Middleton (Wis.) High School. Zach will attend UW-Madison beginning in fall 2021 to study Computer Science. He also loves languages, including Spanish and his latest linguistic challenge – teaching himself Chinese. One day, he plans to travel internationally and put his language skills to work in places like Spain, Latin America or China.\n\r\n“People who are quick to judge on first impression often don’t realize how bright Zach is,” says Jean. “But those who take the time to get know him become very loyal to Zach and appreciate how much more there is to him than a kid in a wheelchair.”\n\r\nDr. Stadler took plenty of time getting to know Zach, and the two of them bonded right away.\n\r\n“That meant just as much to Zach as what Dr. Stadler did for him surgically,” says Jean. \r\n\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>There&#39;s something to be said for looking better than you feel.</p><p>Just ask Amber Pena, who was 32 while she was being treated for breast cancer. She was working a full time job in a busy office, running her own business and being mom to an active 11-year-old boy.</p><p>So it helped that she was able to use cooling caps while going through chemotherapy, which allowed her to keep the majority of her thick, long, black hair.</p><p>“It made me look better than I actually felt,’’ said Pena, who lives in Pecatonica, Ill. “I felt like hell on days after chemo, but nobody had a clue. My closest family and my boss knew, but I worked through the whole thing, and a lot of people had no idea.”</p><p>Cooling caps were approved by the FDA in 2017, and UW Health obtained the Paxman cooling cap system a few months later for its locations at University Hospital and 1. S. Park Street. Pena was the second patient to use the system. </p><p>Patients using the system pay $500 for caps that they keep, and another $250 for each treatment. A fund at the UW Health Breast Center, which comes from people who purchase Pink Lights in honor of breast cancer month, can help those who can’t afford the caps.</p><p>Pena says it was worth it, especially because it spared her 11-year-old son, Anthony, from worry and from having to explain to his friends when his mom came to his sports events.</p><p>“People stare when you are bald, they don’t know how to act,’’ she said. “I could tell the people I wanted to tell. It saved my son from embarrassment and avoided questions I didn’t want to have to answer.</p><p>“On my worst days, it helped me feel a little better.”</p><p>Pena says that her breast surgeon, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8748</span>, suggested trying the cooling caps. She said they worked so well for her that her medical oncologist used to tease her.\r</p><p>“When my oncologist sees me, she freaks out,’’ Pena said. “She says, &#39;I don’t know if I even gave you chemo or not.&#39;”</p><p>In truth, Pena figures that she lost about 40 percent of her hair, but says it wasn’t noticeable to others because her hair is so thick to begin with. Her advice to other women is not to give up on the cooling caps, because she thought she was losing a lot of hair, but ultimately was very pleased with how much she retained.</p><p>Her other advice is to “baby your hair.” Wash it no more than twice a week and avoid stressing it with treatments or tight ponytails.</p><p>Pena is happy to have her treatment behind her. She had surgery and chemotherapy in Madison and radiation therapy closer to home at SwedishAmercian Hospital in Rockford, Ill.</p><p>“It was a rough year. When you’re first diagnosed, you have nightmares, but as you go on, it becomes a little easier,’’ she said. “Everyone says, ‘Your hair is beautiful.’ No one knows what I went through, except those closest to me.”</p>",

In one of his worst moments, his wife Valerie found him at 5 a.m. one morning in his closet, inexplicably trying to open a travel bottle of Listerine.</p><p>Michael, who lives in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was sick. He needed help. Ultimately, it came from the Veterans Administration—first in Rhinelander; then in Iron Mountain, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and finally at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nHis problems started in 2017, when his legs started swelling and itching, and his bathroom trips were much more frequent. Then, he experienced twitching in his hands and, within just a few weeks, lost all his muscle mass. His liver wasn’t functioning correctly, and it was feeding off all the protein he consumed.\r\n\r\n“He looked like he had aged 30 years in three weeks,” says Valerie.\r\n\r\nMichael, who served in the U.S. Army for three years in the mid-1970s, recovered from that particular incident with treatment, and his health stabilized for a time. He was even able to continue working the entire time at his business, Mike’s Rhinelander Glass. But his liver function was bad enough to land him a spot on the transplant list at UW Health, which is connected to the VA in Madison (the other VA facilities in Wisconsin and Iron Mountain are not VA-certified liver transplant centers). In April 2019, Michael received the gift of life with a new liver.\r\n\r\n“My care was extraordinary,” he says. “Everyone treated me with respect.”\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that he needed a hernia repair surgery just a week after his transplant surgery, Michael has recovered remarkably well. He still works full time, and he and Valerie like to go on road trips around the Midwest. In fact, a couple months after Michael’s transplant, they went on a weekend getaway.\r\n\r\n“I have really good days,” Michael says. “I mow my own grass with a push mower and I walk every day to the park. I feel so much better now. I’m so grateful to all those who took care of me, and to my donor. Their life lives on with me.”\r\n\r</p>",

Some time after that, she saw a gastroenterologist, who found a medication that worked for nearly two decades until Irene’s fluid buildup was too much for her to handle.\r\n\r\nIn September 2020, Irene had to quit her job in hospice and home care because she was too sick. “I would go to work, come home and lie on the couch for the rest of the night, because I was just too tired,” she says. \r\n\r\nAt that time, she started seeing Michael Lucey, MD, gastroenterologist and medical director of the liver transplant program at UW Health. Dr. Lucey determined Irene’s liver was so bad that her kidney had stopped functioning properly, too, and he hospitalized her and got her on the wait list for a liver transplant. Just a few weeks later on June 4, 2021, she received her miracle.\r\n\r\n“When they called me and asked when I could be in Madison for my new liver, I said, ‘Oh my God, I love you!

      "story": "<p><b>When Brooke Dupree was first diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 11, a nurse who was trying to distract her from tests asked what her favorite candy was.</b> Brooke said a Snickers bar. The nurse, who worked at a South Carolina Hospital, then informed her that was too bad, because she would never be able to eat a Snickers bar again.</p><p>She was wrong. Twenty-nine years later, Brooke bid diabetes a not-so-fond farewell after receiving the gift of life with a pancreas transplant at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. She never forgot the nurse’s statement and decided to name her new pancreas “Snickers.” “I wish I knew that nurse’s name, so I could go back and tell her how things turned out for me,” says Brooke. </p><h3>A lifetime of worry</h3><p>Brooke spent almost three decades living with diabetes. She grew up in a small town in South Carolina in the 1990s, where none of her classmates knew about diabetes and gave her a hard time about it. She even had a teacher try to snatch her insulin pump off the side of her jeans because she thought it was a beeper. But Brooke did the best she could—sometimes managing her disease well, sometimes not so well. Life moved forward, and though it was a difficult pregnancy, she and her husband Travis were able to have a child.</p><p>Shortly after Brooke, Travis and their daughter Caroline moved to Greenville, South Carolina, they went to a skate night for Caroline’s school. They sat at a table with an unfamiliar family, and the mother noticed the tattoo on Brooke’s wrist that indicated she had diabetes. She said her husband had suffered from diabetes before he had a pancreas transplant. “I looked at my husband and was completely blown away,” says Brooke. “I had no idea a pancreas transplant was an option for people with diabetes.”</p><p>Brooke began investigating the possibility, talking to staff at several transplant centers close to their home. But most of the centers predicted she would wait several years for a transplant, which was too long for her. In February 2019, she and her husband, Travis, flew to UW Health in Madison, which was where their neighbor had received his transplant. They were shocked by the amount of snow on the ground but heartened by the care they received. “Other than the weather, everything was so amazing,” says Brooke. “I felt like I could sit there and ask as many questions as I wanted. It was all smiles, all the time. I’d never been treated like that before. By the time we left, I had decided I was ready. There was no doubt in my mind that this was what we needed to do.”</p><p>At the end of May 2019, Brooke and Travis drove their camper across the country from South Carolina to await Brooke’s gift of life in Madison. She received her pancreas transplant in late July 2019. </p><p>Now, she is back to her job as an English instructor at a small technical college, and she and her family can feel much more comfortable making travel plans. “I can go outside and work all day in the garden if I want, without stopping because I have a low blood sugar episode,” she says. “My diabetes was a constant concern—and now it’s not.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>Amber Noggle was 20 weeks pregnant when she went in for what she expected to be a routine ultrasound.</p><p>Once the scan was complete, Amber got nervous as several more medical staff entered the room. The next words she and her husband, Dustin, heard changed everything immediately.</p><p>“We need to talk. It’s about your baby boy’s heart.”</p><p>Suddenly, Amber learned that the baby she was carrying had a rare, complex heart defect called <a href=\"https://www.uwhealthkids.org/cardiology-cardiothoracic-surgery/tetralogy-of-fallot/33790\">tetralogy of fallot</a> with pulmonary atresia. Babies with this defect have five abnormalities: completely obstructed blood flow from the heart to the lungs; a hole between the heart’s lower chambers; an overriding aorta; a thickened right ventricle; and abnormal pulmonary arteries. Major surgery is typically performed not long after the baby’s birth.</p><p>While trying to come to terms with the jolting news she just heard, Amber couldn’t help but find incredible irony in the situation.</p><p>As a popular news anchor on Madison’s WKOW-TV 27 and active board member of the American Heart Association – Wisconsin Chapter, Amber has reported on several other babies from south-central Wisconsin who underwent open heart surgery.</p><p>Now, Amber and Dustin were about to experience their own emotional rollercoaster.</p><p>“Things happen for a reason,” says Amber, “Telling the stories of other families helped prepare us for what was to come, although it affects you differently when it’s your own child.”</p><p>“It’s a huge shock,” says Sara Babcock, clinical nurse specialist at the UnityPoint Health – Meriter – Center for Perinatal Care. “We do our best not only to provide families like Amber’s with information, but to help them deal with the emotional turmoil that often follows.”</p><blockquote><p>They took care of Daxton like he was their own and surrounded him with love. We really could not have asked for anything more.</p></blockquote><p>Four more months filled with ultrasounds, echocardiograms, and other tests would slowly pass, involving multiple UW Health experts in maternal fetal medicine, neonatology, pediatric cardiology, pediatric heart surgery and pediatric critical care.</p><p>Despite a planned induction, Amber’s baby emerged on his own timetable. On July 16, 2018, at 37 weeks’ gestation, baby Daxton entered the world at UnityPoint Health – Meriter. Due to Daxton’s heart condition, Amber had only a minute to meet her new baby before he went to the <a href=\"https://www.unitypoint.org/madison/services-nicu.aspx\">Level III NICU</a> for stabilization.</p><p>Amber and Daxton stayed at UnityPoint Health – Meriter for two days before Daxton was transferred via CHETA ambulance to American Family Children’s Hospital to prepare for open heart surgery.</p><p>“I was so grateful Daxton and I could be together those first couple of days,” says Amber. “In some cases, the baby has to be taken to surgery before the mom even recovers from delivery.”</p><p>After overcoming several unexpected hurdles, Daxton was taken to the operating room on his 11th day, where pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8971</span>, known as “Dr. A.”, performed the 9-hour surgical repair.</p><p>The surgery was a great success,” says Amber. “Dr. A and his team worked a miracle on Daxton’s tiny heart.”</p><p>After spending 11 more days in the hospital recovering, Daxton came home. Now three months old, Daxton is doing very well.</p><p>“He eats like crazy and is growing very fast,” says Amber. “He smiles and giggles a lot, which is so great to see given all he has been through.”</p><p>Daxton’s pediatric cardiologist, <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/j-carter-ralphe-md/8188\">J. Carter Ralphe, MD</a>, says that while Daxton will require lifelong cardiac care, he should have few, if any, limitations.</p><p>“We’re very pleased with Daxton’s progress,” says Dr. Ralphe. “He should grow like a normal child and do very well.”</p><p>Despite many worrisome days and nights, Amber and Dustin are incredibly grateful that their son is alive and healthy.</p><p>“We owe so much to everyone at UnityPoint Health – Meriter and American Family Children’s Hospital,” Amber says. “They took care of Daxton like he was their own and surrounded him with love. We really could not have asked for anything more.”\n</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Colton Liam Edwin Cox is a big name for a little 4-year-old guy.</b> His short stature stems from a rare genetic condition that makes his bones shorter than normal. Colton has achondroplasia, which affects about 1 in 25,000 newborns.</p><p>\r“Having achondroplasia is kind of like the body applying an unwanted parking brake to the bones that are trying to grow,” said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9753</span>, a UW Health Kids pediatrician in genetics who directs the Midwest Regional <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C879</span> at UW-Madison’s Waisman Center. “While kids like Colton require care from highly trained medical experts, he is fortunate to have an incredibly engaged, supportive family. Although achondroplasia affects his bones, it doesn’t affect his mind, his drive or his willpower. There are no limits on what he can do.”</p><p>The outlook for Colton was not always so promising. Even while Amber was pregnant, signs of abnormal bone growth began appearing on her ultrasounds. A neonatal nurse practitioner herself, at a children’s hospital 500 miles from Madison, Amber felt haunted by the “nurse curse” of knowing too much about potential complications with her baby. On top of this, merely getting pregnant took some time, as Amber and her husband Dennis ultimately sought the help of in vitro fertilization (IVF), which was successful.\r</p><h3>Colton almost didn’t survive mom’s pregnancy\r</h3><p>At 27 weeks into pregnancy, Amber thought she lost her baby in utero from an unrelated complication that forced her to stay on bed rest for four weeks. At 31 weeks, the complication intensified, forcing doctors to deliver Colton by emergency Caesarean section. He was immediately taken to the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C1019</span>, where he would stay for four months.</p><p>“Like many preemies,” Amber said, “Colton was small, but his arms and legs were tiny, even for a preemie. With my medical knowledge, I saw things that were worrisome, like a prominent forehead and unusual breathing patterns. Nobody could tell me exactly what was wrong, but I knew something was wrong. My ‘mom gut’ kept telling me to speak up, and I’m thankful I did.”\r</p><p>Eventually, genetics experts at Amber’s local hospital concluded that he had a form of dwarfism. Amber knew enough to suspect achondroplasia, and her hunch would prove correct.</p><p>Colton was surviving, but there were still many unanswered questions during the four months he and Amber spent in the NICU. Fortunately, another mother put Amber in touch with Dr. Legare, one of the nation’s preeminent achondroplasia experts and part of the UW Health Kids network of care.\r</p><p>“Dr. Legare was a godsend,” Amber said. “There are about 10 pediatricians in the country as well-versed in achondroplasia as she is. Connecting with her began to provide answers and hope.” \r</p><p>Not long after that conversation, Amber, Dennis and Colton flew to Madison to see Dr. Legare and her partner in the Bone Dysplasia Clinic, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10630</span>, a UW Health Kids neurosurgeon with extensive experience operating on children with genetic bone abnormalities. </p><h3>It felt like Colton was in good hands</h3><p>Relief began to ensue, as Amber knew that she and her baby were in the right hands.</p><p>“There are only a handful of comprehensive pediatric bone dysplasia programs in the country,” said Dr. Legare, “and most of them are on the coasts. These are rare abnormalities, but fortunately they are not rare to Dr. Stadler, me or our UW Health colleagues in orthopedics, ENT, neuropsychology and sleep medicine.”\r</p><p>As Colton approached his first birthday, it became clear that he would need a unique form of skull surgery with which very few pediatric neurosurgeons are highly experienced, like Dr. Stadler.</p><p>“Some kids with achondroplasia, including Colton, experience compression between the brain stem and the oval-shaped opening at the base of the skull,” said Dr. Stadler. “His arms and legs had trouble growing, and so did the base of his skull, leaving too small of an opening where the spinal cord turns into the brain stem. Left untreated, the situation could be life-threatening.”</p><p>In November 2018, Colton and his family returned to American Family Children’s Hospital, where Dr. Stadler took Colton to the operating room, removing small sections of his skull at the back of the neck to create more space around the spinal cord and brain stem.</p><h3>An explosive growth in development\r</h3><p>“Colton recovered very nicely and has had an explosive growth in development since then,” said Dr. Stadler.</p><p>“It really was a night-and-day change,” said Amber. “Before the surgery, he couldn’t hold his head up or pick his head up off the floor. After a few months, he was doing so much better. He truly was like a new kid.”\r</p><p>Some expected delays – such as not walking until age 2½ – followed, but today at age 4, Colton is an incredibly happy, social, smart little boy who loves preschool.\r</p><p>“It might take him a little longer to get from Point A to Point B,” Amber said, “or he might need a chair or stool to reach what he wants. Still, we could not be more thankful to have him in our life, especially knowing how close we were to losing him.”\r</p><p>Colton is quite artistic. He draws, paints and crafts to his heart’s content. While out and about, he charms the ladies who are drawn to his smiling face.\r</p><p>For Dr. Legare, Dr. Stadler and the other caregivers on their bone dysplasia team, Colton is just one of many children that brings them incredible pleasure. Children from more than a dozen states and even overseas have been treated at this clinic.</p><p>“We wish the more distant families like Colton’s didn’t have to travel so far, but thanks to telemedicine, we are able to conduct many appointments over video. The overall goal of our care is for children like Colton to live a rich full life and reach their optimal potential,” said Dr. Legare.\r</p>",

She also had persistent headaches and chronic pain in her left side, but doctors simply shrugged their shoulders and said she would have to learn to live with it.</p><p>Then, Jenna met David Foley, MD, FACS, and the renal autotransplant team at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, and she finally found the answers she was seeking. Now, she is recovering from a renal autotransplant—a procedure that has helped many people who thought they would be in pain for the rest of their lives. “I can see the light at the end of the tunnel,” she says.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, Jenna, who lives in Castalia, Iowa, learned she had Graves’ disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause heart palpitations and fatigue. When she tried to find treatment to ease her symptoms, doctors told her that her body was going to hurt, and there was nothing she could do about it. Then, in April 2020, Jenna became very sick with excruciating back pain. During one of the computed tomography (CT) scans her doctors ordered, a doctor mentioned her vein was pinched, but said it wasn’t a big deal.\r\n\r\nJenna, however, felt she had just learned some important information. She started Googling “pinched veins,” and soon she discovered nutcracker syndrome, a rare condition in which the vein that drains the left kidney is compressed by an artery in the abdomen, resulting in significant pain. “I thought, this is my life!” she says.\r\n\r\nIn her research, Jenna found the UW Health Renal Autotransplant Program, one of the only programs in the nation that was helping people with nutcracker syndrome and other vein compression diseases. Dr. Foley agreed to see her in February 2021, and sure enough, he found she had nutcracker syndrome. More importantly, he knew he could fix it. “That was so huge,” Jenna says, “getting validation that I wasn’t crazy. There really was something wrong with me!”\r\n\r\nAfter a few more tests, Jenna scheduled her renal autotransplant for May 7. During the procedure, Dr. Foley removed her left kidney and ureter and placed them in a different spot near her right hip. She stayed in Madison for a week, then traveled back to Iowa to recover at home.\r\n\r\nNow, Jenna is feeling herself slowly return to normal. Her headaches—which had been constant for many months—are gone, and she feels better every week. She and her family recently moved to a farm, and the fresh air and scenery have been good for her recovery. “I’ve just been so happy with UW Health,” she said. “The staff has been amazing.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>When Megan Van Swol was 30 weeks pregnant with her son Charlie, doctors considered her pregnancy high risk because she didn’t have much amniotic fluid in her uterus.</b> During an ultrasound, a specialist couldn’t find Charlie’s kidneys, but he told her not to worry about it.</p><p>\rMonths later, Megan and Charlie’s father, Zack Woldt, learned they should indeed be concerned about their son’s health. During an emergency room visit, doctors noticed the baby was anemic and performed blood tests. The tests showed Charlie was quite sick and needed immediate care. “He was always hurting, but he couldn’t tell me why he was hurting,” says Zach. “I was relieved that someone was finally doing something about it.”\r\n\r\nCharlie, who lives in Shawano and Dale, Wisconsin, was transferred by ambulance to a hospital in Milwaukee. Doctors there diagnosed him with acute kidney failure. Over the next few weeks, Charlie underwent surgery to have his ureter opened, and he received a feeding tube and catheter. After he returned home, he started dialysis—his parents had to hook him up to the dialysis machine for 10 hours every night. He ended up being on dialysis for three and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe only way Charlie could ever recover was to undergo a kidney transplant. The UW Health Pediatric Kidney Transplant Program is a Center of Excellence. Because of this, and the program’s excellent outcomes, Charlie’s family transferred his care to UW Health and the American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. \r\n\r\nWhile children who need kidney transplants can go on the wait list for a deceased donor kidney, the best option is for them to find a living donor. Zack was eager to undergo testing, and sure enough, he was a good match for his son. “He’s my boy. He calls me daddy and my heart melts. I would do anything for him,” he says.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 2021, Zack donated his kidney at University Hospital and a team at AFCH led by Dr. Tony D’Alessandro, Surgical Director of Pediatric Kidney Transplantation, transplanted Zack’s lifesaving gift into Charlie. Charlie was 4½ years old and stayed at American Family Children’s Hospital, while Zack received care just across the skywalk at University Hospital. Throughout the whole ordeal, Megan says, Charlie was in a perpetually good mood. Just a week after his transplant, he tried to run down the hall of the hospital. “He really had a lot of fun—for being in a hospital,” she says. </p><p>Megan says she was especially impressed with the physical therapy team at the hospital, who worked hard with Charlie to help him prepare to go home. She remembers one physical therapist—his favorite—who made squirt guns out of syringes with Charlie.\r\n\r\nNow, Charlie is off dialysis and enjoying his life as an almost-5-year-old. “He’s a lover, but he’s also a comedian,” says Megan. “There’s never a dull day with him.”\r\n\r\n“Charlie and his family have been terrific advocates for his health and well-being,” says Dr. Sharon Bartosh, Medical Director of the Pediatric Kidney Transplant program and Charlies nephrologist. “We are grateful they had enough confidence in our team’s abilities and our pediatric transplant outcomes to place their trust in us.” \r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Gary and Dennis Thiel of Appleton, WI had no idea what was going on when they began experiencing shortness of breath in their early-to-mid 60s.</b> Little did they dream that 2020, the year that COVID-19 turned life upside down for so many – would become the year that these two brothers would ultimately receive brand new hearts.</p><p>Gary, a 69-year-old retired UPS driver and one-time avid walker, vividly remembers when his stamina began to wane.\n\r\n“I remember stopping my walk every 50 feet or so to catch my breath. It was scary and I became resigned to the fact that I wasn’t going to live too long,” says Gary, who has been married to his wife Diane for 42 years and has three grown daughters.\n\r\nBreathing was also getting harder for Gary’s younger brother Dennis, 67. Shortly before retiring from his job as a forklift operator, Dennis remembers when a simple walk to his locker or the parking lot included multiple stops to catch his breath.\n\r\nCardiologists in the Fox Valley began treating both men for abnormal heart rhythms, but their symptoms persisted. It was difficult for doctors not to wonder if a familial condition might be causing both brothers to experience similar breathing difficulties at about the same point in life.\n\r</p><h3>Rare genetic condition caused heart failure, leading to transplants</h3><p>Ultimately, Gary, and later Dennis, were diagnosed with a rare, life-threatening and often under-recognized genetic condition known as transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis. As this is a slow, progressive disease, patients typically have no idea that they have the condition until they are in their 50s, 60s or later. This disease can involve any organ system but is usually not diagnosed until symptoms from heart failure occur.\n\r\n“TTR is a type of protein produced in the liver that is carried throughout the bloodstream,” says Dr. David Pham, a UW Health transplant cardiologist who specializes in cardiac amyloidosis. “In people with TTR amyloidosis, the TTR protein misfolds into amyloid fibril, so instead of flowing freely, it builds up in the heart, the nerves, the digestive system and other places in the body. Gary and Dennis started having breathing problems because TTR amyloid fibrils were building up in their hearts, causing it to thicken and stiffen, eventually leading to heart failure.”\n\r\nOf the two major types of TTR amyloidosis, one is genetic. Because Gary tested for this type, doctors were able to diagnose Dennis more easily, and he also tested positive for the genetic type. Accordingly, the Thiels encouraged other family members to get tested for the genetic marker. Although they are the only two (of seven) siblings who developed heart failure, genetic testing revealed the marker is present in two more brothers, two of Gary’s three daughters, a niece and a nephew.\n\r\n“Dennis and I are the only ones in the family who actually got the disease, so I guess we took one for the team,” says Gary in a classic understatement.</p><h3>\rA lot to process in very little time</h3><p>Three life-changing events transformed March 2020 into an unforgettable month for Gary.\n\r\nOn March 4, a biopsy confirmed the genetic amyloidosis condition that was wreaking havoc with his heart. COVID-19 effectively shut down much of the country just one week later and by the end of that month, Gary was put on the wait list for a heart transplant. Wait time for organs at UW Health’s Transplant Center are shorter than the regional and national average, and Gary received his new heart just three days after being listed.\n\r\n“Gary did wonderfully,” says UW Health’s Dr. Amy Fiedler, his transplant surgeon. “He really sailed through the operation. During his recovery, he always had a smile on his face and was incredibly motivated to work hard and take good care of his new heart.”\n\r\nGary’s recovery included a few bumps in the road. Not being able to see his family members because of COVID-19 visitor restrictions added to his sense of isolation, but his nursing team stepped up to fill some of the void. After two separate hospital stays, Gary was able to go home.\n\r</p><h3>Dennis received a new heart six months after Gary did</h3><p>\rDennis, who received his new heart about six months after Gary, had a rockier road to transplant. In July 2019 – nearly a year before his amyloid diagnosis – Dennis had a stroke. Casey, his 29-year-old son who lives with Dennis, immediately suspected trouble when he heard his father speaking incoherently.\n\r\nTen months went by before genetic testing confirmed that like Gary, Dennis also suffered from TTR amyloidosis. Soon, he was evaluated for a heart transplant, but those plans were put on hold once Dennis had a second stroke a year after the first one.\n\r\n“My dad was in bed when I came in to say goodnight,” says Casey. “I found him totally non-responsive, and he was clearly worse than after the first stroke. Things looked pretty bleak, but luckily, the blood clot finally split off on its own into smaller clots and my dad survived.”\n\r\nDennis still wanted a new heart, but doctors wanted to be sure he would recover well enough from the stroke to survive transplant surgery.\n\r\nBy mid-September, Dennis was strong enough to qualify for a transplant and 25 days later, he got the call that a new heart was available.\n\r\n“I remember driving to Madison feeling like a dead man walking,” Dennis says. “I was scared about the whole thing, but of course incredibly grateful that I was going to get a new heart.”\r\nFrom the surgeon’s perspective, everything about Dennis’ transplant went smoothly.\n\r\n“It’s always good news for the patient when the surgery is not especially memorable,” says UW Health cardiothoracic surgeon Josh Hermsen, MD. “Everything went very well.”\n\r</p><h3>Their signature quality: incredible kindness</h3><p>\rIn addition to a skilled healthcare team and two generous donors willing to give the gift of life, a successful transplant also requires that each patient treat their new organs with a lot of TLC. Many on Dennis’ and Gary’s care teams recognize them for their kindness, gratitude and commitment in this regard.\n\r\nKatie Csizmadia, a UW Health cardiothoracic surgery inpatient nurse, was genuinely touched when told that Dennis remembered her by name several months after his surgery.\n\r\n“I still think of Dennis frequently,” says Katie. “He is so kind, inquisitive and truly committed to doing the hard work we ask of these patients. Knowing that I made a small impact on Dennis in his journey to recovery reminds me why I became a nurse. And if Gary is anything like Dennis, I’m sure he is also a wonderful person.”\n\r\nGary and Dennis are far better off than they were before their heart transplants, but both brothers are realistic about living with the other symptoms caused by their genetic condition.\n\r\n“They probably would not have lived more than a few months without getting new hearts, but TTR amyloidosis, unfortunately, still remains in their bodies,” says UW Health’s Dr. Aurangzeb Baber, a transplant cardiologist.\n\r</p><h3>Hoping to avoid kidney transplants\r</h3><p>Their disease frequently affects the kidneys, and Gary and Dennis may one day need dialysis or kidney transplants if their already compromised renal systems deteriorate further. For now, thankfully, their kidney function remains stable and both men hope to avoid going through a kidney transplant.\n\r\nNeuropathy, or nerve damage, is another TTR amyloidosis symptom impacting the two brothers. Pain in the legs and loss of sensation in the feet, for example, make it hard to walk and maintain a normal sense of balance. They also lack the stamina they had just a few years ago, which limits their daily physical activity. A new medication called Onpattro® is helping stop the advancement of the neuropathy, and doctors anticipate their nerve condition will stabilize and hopefully improve over time.\n\r\n“Gary and Dennis are fairly early in their course of treatment,” says UW Health neurologist Michael Hansen. “There have been no major side effects and I anticipate they will continue to feel better the longer they are on the medication.”\n\r\nTrying to stay as active as possible, Gary plays golf and mows his lawn while Dennis bicycles outdoors and uses a stationary bike in the house. They are both lucky to be alive and incredibly grateful patients.\n\r\n“Gary and Dennis have been through a saga, but their incredible decency and kindness never wavers,” says Dr. Hansen. “Their positive outlook also should bode well for them in the long term.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>When Michael Hill was told that he would need surgery</b> to remove a baseball-size tumor from his colon, he had little doubt that his UW Health surgeon, Dr. Ray King, had the training and experience to do the job.</p><p>What surprised Michael, however, was how kind, attentive and empathetic Dr. King was. Michael’s wife, Sharon, and his son, Alex, were also impressed by King’s approach.\n \r\n“My dad was, frankly, scared out of his mind,” says Alex, a physician assistant. “He was only 59 when he was diagnosed with colon cancer after a routine colonoscopy. He was very nervous about the surgery and the whole situation, understandably.”\n\r\nDr. King sensed Michael’s anxiety, but also knew he was speaking to a well-educated former corporate finance executive. \n\r\n“Dr. King spoke on a level that wasn’t over my dad’s head or beneath his intelligence,” says Alex. “He told my dad that there would be some days that suck but that his cancer was treatable. He also said he’d be with my dad every step of the way.”\n\r\nDuring that first appointment, Dr. King’s attention never drifted for a moment.\n\r\n“Dr. King was totally present, as if he had nobody else to see,” Alex says. “He never looked at his phone or his watch and gave my dad his personal cell number. That was incredibly reassuring because my dad felt respected and heard. The word ‘awesome’ gets over-used these days, but Dr. King was truly awesome.”\n\r</p><h3>Straight talk with an empathetic touch\n\r</h3><p>While Dr. King doesn’t believe in sugar coating information, he tries to be as optimistic as the situation allows.\n\r\n“Patients can see right through you if you try to BS them,” says Dr. King. “For Michael, I wanted him to know that we had a sound plan, the odds were in his favor and he would not need to wear a colostomy bag. Just as important, however, I wanted Michael to know that I am not just a robot who takes out a cancer. I understand the emotional aspect of this disease and try to connect with my patients and their family members on that level.”\n\r\nOn June 21, 2021, Michael successfully underwent surgery and his tumor was removed.\n\r\n“We did a standard laparoscopic surgery to cut out the tumor and reconnect the colon,” says Dr. King. “Michael did great and his recovery has been going well.”</p><h3>\rChemotherapy targets microscopic cancer cells left behind</h3><p>\rWhile surgery was the frontline weapon against Michael’s tumor, many patients with his type of colon cancer also undergo chemotherapy to kill any microscopic cancer cells that may get left behind.\n\r\n“In cases like Michael’s, you don’t know for sure if chemotherapy is necessary, but having it done kills the cells we can’t see, which only increases his chances of reaching a full cure,” says UW Health’s Dr. Noelle LoConte, Michael’s medical oncologist with the UW Carbone Cancer Center.\n\r\n“Aside from some of the usual side effects of chemotherapy, Michael is doing well. We will follow him closely over the next few years.”\n\r\nDr. LoConte also highly recommends bringing a family member or friend to appointments – if possible – as Michael did with his wife and son.\n\r\n“There is so much information to cover, and for many cancer patients, it all sounds like the ‘wah-wah-wah’ teacher voice from the old ‘Peanuts’ cartoons,” says Dr. LoConte. “I can’t overstate the importance of having an advocate at your side to better capture the information and ask questions.”</p><h3>\rColon cancer screening can save your life</h3><p>\rMichael’s case also perfectly illustrates the life-saving power of colon cancer screenings, which adults should begin having at age 45. (In 2021, experts reduced the recommended age for starting screenings from 50 to 45).\n\r\n“Fewer men and women are dying from colon cancer over the last 40 years primarily because more people are getting screened,” says Dr. LoConte. “This is one of the easiest cancers to prevent and we have a menu of screening options from traditional colonoscopy to virtual colonoscopy to at-home kits. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, so we encourage anyone 45 and older who is not getting routine colon cancer screenings to talk with their doctor. It could mean the difference between a curable and incurable cancer, just as it did for Michael.” \r\n</p>",

She and her parents later learned that if they had waited one more day to seek treatment, she probably would have died. As Jennifer underwent tests and saw doctors that day, she cried because she just wanted cake for her birthday. Her friend brought her a Butterfinger bar at the hospital, which brought a fresh round of tears because she couldn’t eat it.\r\n\r\nAs she grew into a teenager, Jennifer’s blood sugar levels never really stabilized. She experienced hypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which she didn’t experience symptoms of low blood sugar until she was in a dangerous situation. “Every paramedic in town knew my name,” she says. “And I live in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which is not a small city. I would stay up at night and beg God to allow me to wake up in the morning.”\r\n\r\nAfter many years of suffering, Jennifer heard about the pancreas transplant program at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. She was amazed by the idea that an organ transplant could put an end to her frequent emergency room visits. She qualified for the wait list in November 2017, and on March 10, 2018, she received the gift of life with a new pancreas.\r\n\r\nThough she experienced complications after her surgery, Jennifer (whose lifelong nickname is “Sugar” because of her condition) was buoyed by a group of three fellow pancreas transplant recipients she met along the way. The four women keep in touch with each other daily through a group text, and Jennifer has made matching shirts for all of them.\r\n\r\nAs for her health…Jennifer doesn’t need insulin anymore and feels much better than she did earlier in life. “I eat something sweet every single day,” she says now.\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>Over the past 20 years, Nikki Loichinger has seen gastroenterologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, gynecologists and pain specialists.</b> But until she sat down with the Renal Autotransplant Program staff at UW Health in Madison, she never found anyone who understood what was wrong with her—or how to fix it.</p><p>Simply put, Nikki was in constant pain in the lower left quadrant of her body. After her kidney autotransplant in April 2021, however, she experienced the joy of release. “I have none of the pains I had been suffering from for the past six years,” she says. “They’re all gone.”\r\n\r</p><h3>No end to the pain\n\r</h3><p>You could almost mistake Nikki’s medical history for a comprehensive list of procedures offered at any given hospital. As doctors tried in vain to treat her pain, the Hartland, Wisconsin, woman underwent a hysterectomy, bowel resection, exploratory laparoscopy, appendectomy, and gallbladder surgery. Doctors even installed a spinal cord stimulator in her body that created much more pain than it alleviated. \r\n\r\nDesperate for relief, Nikki—a mom of two teenagers—tried acupuncture, nerve blocking injections and shots in her belly. “I have been called a doctor hopper and a woman who was just looking for pain medications,” she says. “But that wasn’t true. Not once did I go to a specialist seeking drugs. I just wanted answers.”\r\n\r\nThen, in October 2020, her mother’s friend sent her mother a Washington Post story about a woman whose symptoms matched Nikki’s. She was diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome, a rare vein compression disorder that occurs when arteries squeeze the left renal vein. The story had a happy ending: The woman had found treatment at UW Health.\r\n\r\nArmed with a potential diagnosis, Nikki frantically began Googling “nutcracker syndrome,” which led her to even more stories about women who were just like her. She contacted her doctor about her discovery, but he dismissed the idea and told her he didn’t think this was the answer. Finally, she contacted UW Health. \r\n\r</p><h3>The answers she needed</h3><p>As Nikki talked with doctors and staff at the UW Health Renal Autotransplant Program, she knew she was in the right place. “I felt like I was finally being heard, that my voice mattered, that I wasn’t crazy,” she says. \r\n\r\nDavid Foley, MD, FACS, transplant surgeon in the Renal Autotransplant Program, examined Nikki’s bloodwork and imaging studies and agreed she might have found the correct diagnosis for herself. She came to Madison in January 2021 for further testing, and sure enough, doctors noticed she had compression in her left renal vein. She wasn’t a textbook case, but they believed they could help her. “I cried and cried with such happiness,” Nikki says. “Dr. Foley and his team were able to give explanations of why this was happening, which I had never gotten before.”\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2021, Nikki underwent a kidney autotransplant, during which Dr. Foley removed her left kidney and ureter and replaced them in a different part of her abdominal area. She was in the hospital for six days, then returned home to Hartland to recover.\r\n\r\nNikki is still sore from surgery. But for her, that small amount of pain is nothing compared to the promise of a new life. She can’t wait to go to her kids’ athletic events and be a “supermom” again. “I was a shell of who I used to be,” she says. “But I told everyone, April 9 is the day I get my life back. The nurses in the hospital couldn’t believe I started walking so quickly after surgery. But I felt like my body had been craving pain relief for so long, I was ready to start life again.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p><b>One Saturday night in January 2021, David Peterson woke up with what felt like the flu. </b>Given the current state of affairs in the world, he was sure he had the coronavirus (COVID-19). </p><p>He sought treatment at a hospital near his home in Roscoe, Ill., but he tested negative for the coronavirus, so the hospital sent him home with antibiotics. Twenty days later, he was back — and much worse. His doctors found a bacterial growth in his heart and transferred him to University Hospital in Madison, where the team went into action.\r</p><p>David’s heart problems first began in 2014, when he suffered from a 7-centimeter aneurysm. Doctors removed the aneurysm and inserted an artificial heart valve. His issues in 2021 occurred because bacteria began to grow on the valve, causing an infection in his heart. Shortly after he arrived at University Hospital, staff scheduled a surgery to replace his valve, and during the surgery, they discovered the infection and had to cut out a large portion of his heart.</p><p>“I learned later I almost died on the table,” David said. “They called my family to the hospital so they could see me one last time.”\r</p><p>David survived the procedure thanks to his doctors, who put a patch on his heart to stop the bleeding. But once he woke up, he was so weak he couldn’t even hold up a cell phone, mainly because his heart had lost most of its function. He would not be able to leave the hospital without a new heart, so UW Health Heart Transplant Program staff performed the necessary tests and got him on the heart transplant list.\r</p><p>Within a week of being placed on the list, David received the call he had been waiting for: There was an available heart that was a good match for him. His doctor informed him that the donor was positive for Hepatitis C virus, but David could receive treatment starting from the day of his transplant so he would not be affected by the disease from his donor.</p><p>David’s new heart was recovered from a donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor. UW Health is one of just a few transplant centers involved in a trial study on the use of DCD hearts. During this process, organs are retrieved from a patient after his or her heart stops. Health care professionals then perfuse the heart in warm blood and are able to assess the organ’s viability, essentially “reanimating” it for use in another person. The study has the potential of radically increasing the number of donor hearts that are available and saving more lives, like David’s.\r\n\r\nDavid was just fine with accepting a Hepatitis C positive DCD heart. “I wanted the first heart that became available,” he said. “As long as they deemed it healthy enough for transplant. The whole staff on the transplant floor was great. They were true professionals.”\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after David returned home to Roscoe, he started making calls for work (he’s a small engine parts salesman). After about a month, he returned to the road. “I’m pretty strong-willed,” he said. “I’m feeling really good.\r</p>",

That led her to the UW Health <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 1LpsqlWQAyXXcxnKNAxcbM</span> (RAP), where she finally found a treatment that worked.\r\n\r\nSarah, 43, knows now that she has had vascular compression issues her whole life. But she first started experiencing debilitating symptoms in 2019. She felt sick to her stomach and was vomiting all the time, and she had chronic pain in her back and stomach area. An emergency room doctor diagnosed her with superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMA), a condition that occurs when two arteries pinch the small intestine. But other doctors rejected the diagnosis and accused her of making up her symptoms.\r\n\r\nNear the end of 2019, Sarah learned about nutcracker syndrome, which occurs when two arteries pinch the left renal vein, causing blood to flow backward. Through her online research, she became convinced she suffered from nutcracker syndrome, too (it turned out she also had several other compression syndromes, as well). That was what was causing her extreme pain. A doctor confirmed her self-diagnosis, but the question remained: How could she solve her problem? “I was in so much pain, I couldn’t function at all,” she said. “It was horrible.”\r\n\r\nSarah, who lives in Reedsburg, Wis., connected with transplant coordinators at UW Health’s RAP program, who told her about their kidney autotransplant procedure. During the surgery, the doctor removes the patient’s kidney and ureter and places them in a different spot in the body, thus relieving the compression. Sarah was eager to schedule her surgery as soon as possible, but she had to wait for another surgeon to join the program. She also had to undergo a procedure to fix yet another compression syndrome, celiac artery compression.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, she began testing with the UW Health RAP, and scheduled her surgery for May 24, 2021, with transplant surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080</span>, MD. “It was great to meet with him,” she said. “I had never been treated that way before. Someone automatically believed me and knew exactly what I was talking about.”  \r\n\r\nThe surgery did what it was supposed to do — it eliminated her pain. While Sarah is still working with doctors to treat some of her other compression syndromes, the kidney autotransplant has helped her live her life again. “The pain is what kept me from getting out and doing things and leaving my bed,” she said. “I feel better now.”\r</p>",

But the woman from Charlotte, Tenn., woman found the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 1LpsqlWQAyXXcxnKNAxcbM</span> at UW Health, where doctors performed a procedure that finally gave her relief from her pain.\r\n\r\nEven as a child, Heather suffered from extraordinary pain during her menstrual cycles — pain that caused her to stay home from school several days each month. During her first pregnancy at age 22, she experienced debilitating Braxton-Hicks contractions, a problem which continued and worsened during her second pregnancy. By the time she stopped breastfeeding her third child, her body settled into a pattern of hormone levels that made the pain constant.</p><p>“None of my doctors could figure out what was wrong,” said Heather, who is now 38. “My gynecologist thought I just had really bad PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome).”\r\n\r\nIn 2016, doctors diagnosed her with pelvic congestion, and she underwent a hysterectomy. That eased the pain for about a year, but it came back with a vengeance, much to her exasperation.</p><p>“I could no longer take my daily walks,” she said. “I couldn’t stand up behind the kitchen counter for more than 15 or 20 minutes without being in excruciating pain.”\r\n\r\nEventually, she saw a vascular surgeon who gave her a diagnosis — nutcracker syndrome, a rare condition where the vein that drains the left kidney is compressed by an artery in the abdomen resulting in significant pain. The vascular surgeon placed a stent into a pelvic vein, but that didn’t ease her pain.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Heather found the UW Health Renal Autotransplant Program in Madison, via a Facebook page for people with nutcracker syndrome. Gradually, she learned more about her condition from the other women on the page and found out UW Health had found a solution — renal autotransplant, which involved removing the kidney and ureter and placing it in a different place lower in the abdomen. She called UW Health and spoke with Shanee Ellison, transplant coordinator for the program.</p><p>“She knew exactly what I was talking about,” said Heather. “For so many years, I thought I was just a weak person who wasn’t capable of dealing with pain. To hear that reassurance from her was amazing.”\r\n\r\nAs Heather continued through the process of scheduling her autotransplant surgery, she was especially gratified to work with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080</span>, MD. “He truly cared about my individual case and walked both my husband and me through the plan,” she said. “My family and I were so blessed God pointed us to him and the RAP team.”\r\n\r\nHeather underwent her surgery on June 11, 2021. Even though she still is recovering from the procedure, she can already feel a difference.</p><p>“I can take a deep breath and not feel that crunching pain in my abdomen that has haunted me my whole life,” she said. “I can honestly say for the first time in a long time that I’m thinking about my future.”\r</p>",

The woman from Hermantown, Minn., had extreme pain in her back that wrapped around to the right side of her abdomen. Doctors removed her appendix, but the pain returned a few weeks later.</p><p>That began a cycle during which she needed to be in the hospital about every five weeks with pain, nausea and vomiting, and doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with her. Some accused her of being a drug-seeker, which was incredibly discouraging for her. Finally, one tenacious nephrologist performed enough tests to make a diagnosis: loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS), a rare condition characterized by extreme pain in the area of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nHe sent her to a major midwestern medical center, where doctors performed a “renal denervation” during which they deflated her lung and took out all the nerves between her waist and armpit on her right side. That worked for six months, but then the pain moved to the left side, so they performed the procedure again.</p><p>When the pain continued returning, Marlene’s doctors decided to remove her right kidney, which was functioning at only 10 percent. While that fixed the right side, the pain on her left side was becoming almost unbearable. A pain specialist suggested she try a spinal cord stimulator, which helped a little, but not enough.</p><p>“I thought this was going to be my life,” she says. “I was in the hospital every four to six weeks, and I constantly had to rely on other people to help with my kids.”\r\n\r\nThen, Marlene experienced a breakthrough: She heard about the UW Health <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 1LpsqlWQAyXXcxnKNAxcbM</span> in Madison, through an online acquaintance. Other women with the same condition had experienced miraculous recoveries after undergoing a kidney autotransplant, which involved removing the kidney and ureter causing the pain and placing them in a different part of the body.\r\n\r\nMarlene eventually came to Madison in July 2020 for an evaluation, and her doctors there determined she was a candidate for the procedure. She underwent surgery on Aug. 27, 2020.</p><p>“From the minute I first talked to the nurse coordinator, I felt so comfortable and amazing,” Marlene says. “Everyone was so wonderful. The doctors and the rest of the team treated me like family.” \r\n\r\nNow, Marlene is just like the other women she heard about online — her pain is gone, and she can focus on her family again.</p><p>“Knowing that I don’t have the everyday pain is incredible,” she says. “The staff at UW Health have called me so many times to check in. They have really treated me like family, and I feel so much better.” \r</p>",

The 58-year-old’s heart took just one day to go from perfectly healthy to 10% function. Fortunately, she had the team at the UW Health Heart Transplant Program helping her and received the gift of life with a heart transplant eight days after her cardiac event.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of September 20, 2020, Sarah—who lives in Davis, Illinois—complained of a sore throat to her husband, Mike. After they went to bed, she got up, saying she didn’t feel good. As he followed her downstairs in their house, she told him she thought she was having a heart attack. She wouldn’t let him call 911, so he drove her to the nearest hospital, where doctors performed a catheterization and found a blood clot in her heart. They attempted to place a stent, but while they were doing so, the clot came loose, blocked her blood flow and damaged her heart beyond repair.\r\n\r\nFirst, caregivers transferred Sarah to another, bigger hospital, where doctors used a technique called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to connect Sarah to a machine that acted as an artificial lung for her. Then, they transferred her to University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. Doctors there didn’t know if she was going to live through the night, so Mike called her adult children so they could come say goodbye. “I knew it was bad,” he says. “It was so surreal.”\r\n\r\nSarah’s doctors told Mike they still were hoping Sarah’s heart would return to normal function, but in the meantime, they would perform the necessary tests so she could get on the wait list for a new heart. Within days, she received four different offers for a heart transplant. The one her doctors chose for her, worked like the charm, and she received her gift of life on September 27.\r\n\r\nBecause Sarah was in such good health prior to her cardiac event, she bounced back quickly and was walking two days after surgery. “Everyone at the hospital took such good care of me,” she says. “They explained everything that was happening as we went along. They helped me with anything I asked for, and they were so happy to walk the halls with me. All the nurses and nurse aides who answered my call button never made me feel like I was a problem. Every meal that was delivered to my room came with a smile.”\r\n\r\nSoon after she returned home, Sarah was back to her job performing data entry for an insurance company (she has worked from home since the start of the coronavirus pandemic). She and Mike already were active before her transplant, but they quickly resumed their routine of walking and exercising often. “I never felt afraid throughout all of this,” she says. “I felt like I was in good hands.”\r\n</p>",

So his parents weren’t surprised at all to learn he had registered to be an organ donor when they were facing one of the most difficult decisions of their lives.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 2020, Terry and Donna Sheppard of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, rushed to the hospital when they learned Brandon had been involved in a water accident at a friend’s party. Emergency medical personnel had been able to restart his heart, but he was in a coma, and there had been no oxygen to his brain for 40 minutes. Doctors told them they could treat him for a while, but even if he woke up, he never would be the same again. Sadly, after a few days of waiting, watching, and hoping, Brandon’s condition worsened, and the diagnosis of brain death was confirmed. At this point, only the life-support machines were keeping Brandon’s body functioning and it was time to make some decisions. \r\n\r</p><div></div><p></p><p>“The hardest part was not being able to ask him what he wanted us to do,” says Terry. “I didn’t want to give up.”\r\n\r\nTerry and Donna looked in Brandon’s wallet and found his driver’s license, which indicated he had made the decision to be an organ donor. The organ donor registry was checked, to confirm he was a registered donor, and Brandon’s name was listed. At that point, it was clear what the next step was – honor Brandon’s decision to be a life-saving organ donor.\r\n\r\nBrandon was able to save five people’s lives by donating his organs. But not only was he an organ donor hero—he also was a catalyst through which his family spread the word about organ donation. His siblings spelled out the words “Room of a Hero” in Post-It notes on the window of his hospital room and many family members and friends (including Terry) registered to be organ donors after hearing his story. “It wouldn’t surprise me if a couple hundred people registered as organ donors because of Brandon,” Terry says.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been incredibly difficult for Brandon’s family members as they remember the man who loved wrestling and worked with at-risk youth in an after-school program for his local school district. However, they are grateful he had the opportunity to continue helping others—even after his own life had ended. “The miracle that we were praying for became miracles for other people,” Donna says. “God knew. He already had those miracles in place.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>My journey towards the world of polycystic kidney disease  and kidney transplant began in the early 1990&#39;s when my father was diagnosed with the disease and his physician suggested his children also be checked for this condition.</p><p>I learned that I inherited his condition, but I didn&#39;t have any issues until 2013. I worked with a nephrologist through the summer of 2018, when he said that I would need a kidney transplant or have to go on dialysis.\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t have any relatives that were a match for me, so I began to search for a potential non-related donor. My husband, Bob, an ordained Deacon, suggested that he put a notice out to the Green Bay Diaconate Community. A very special couple, Claire and Steve Letourneaux, came forward when they heard I needed a kidney transplant. Claire was willing to go through the testing process and we soon learned that she was a good match. After the final tests were completed, we learned that Claire&#39;s donation had to be delayed because she needed to have her appendix removed immediately. Her surgery and recovery pushed back the kidney and transplant surgeries to the end of December. We knew it was going to be a different Christmas for all of us.\r\n\r\nTransplant day finally arrived on December 20, 2018, and everything went well. With the help of the caring, professional staff at UW Health, a true Christmas miracle took place. To think that our lives came together 18 years earlier to begin the journey towards Deacon ordination, and then to travel this journey together to help one another to give and receive, this truly felt like Divine intervention.\r\n\r\nIt’s been more than two years now, and we are both doing great. We are fully recovered and each living with one kidney. The good experiences far exceeded the difficult ones and we are all filled with gratitude toward the staff at the UW Health Transplant Center, and for everyone else who held us up in prayer and still continue to do so.\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Ashley LaBeause and her husband, Courtney, spent the better part of a decade trying to get pregnant without success. Married in 2010, the couple eventually opted for <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 14528</span>, or IVF – a sophisticated fertility treatment that mimics sexual reproduction and is responsible for 1 to 2 percent of all births. </p><p>“Ashley was 27 when we first saw her,” says Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10605</span>, one of three UW Health reproductive endocrinologists based at Generations Fertility Care, a Madison-based, highly reputed fertility clinic that is a joint venture of UW Health and UnityPoint Health - Meriter. “Being a younger woman, which worked in her favor, Ashley had a 50-percent chance of having a baby after one round of IVF,” says Dr. Cooney. “Thankfully, we were successful the first time.”</p><p>The LaBeauses, who live in rural Monroe County in southwestern Wisconsin, were referred to Generations by Ashley’s obstetrician, Dr. Catherine Ryan of Gundersen Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin. </p><p>“My husband and I did research on a few fertility centers,” Ashley says, “but Dr. Ryan’s recommendation of Generations was strong. With their higher success rates and convincing testimonials from other couples, we thought it was the perfect place for us. Once we started coming there, we were very pleased because they truly listened to us. We never felt like a number.”</p><p>Generations, which treats about 3,000 patients annually, has experts to address every need for those looking to grow their families.</p><p>“Not every fertility center offers a comprehensive team like ours,” says Dr. Cooney. “In addition to fertility physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses, we have a urologist on staff to address men’s concerns, a health psychologist, a genetics counselor and a team of five embryologists in the laboratory who conduct the egg fertilization and embryo preparation.”</p><h3>What happens during IVF treatment?</h3><p>IVF begins with a series of daily injections that cause the woman to ovulate several eggs at a time instead of the one that is normally released during the menstrual cycle. At just the right time, a physician – typically at a fertility center -- retrieves the eggs during a procedure. Next, the eggs are fertilized in the laboratory with sperm provided by the woman’s partner or a donor. Five days later, the fertilized egg, or embryo, is transferred back into the woman’s uterus with the goal of achieving pregnancy. </p><p>Ashley and Courtney began IVF treatment in October 2019 with regimens of two daily medications -- Courtney gave the injections, although many women do it themselves -- that stimulate the ovaries to grow an abundance of follicles. Typically, this triggers the growth of about 10 eggs, which is the exact number that Ashley produced. She also received another medication that “pumps the brakes” on the process, ensuring that the ovaries do not ovulate too early. </p><p>“With each woman, our goal is to grow as many follicles as possible but only at the optimal time,” says Dr. Cooney. “It’s all about quantity and timing.”</p><p>Patients are routinely seen by any of the three reproductive endocrinologists over the course of their treatment. One of Dr. Cooney’s colleagues, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9674</span>, performed Ashley’s egg retrieval, a procedure that typically lasts 15 to 30 minutes. The 10 eggs were handed off that day to the Generations laboratory staff – known as embryologists – who, in this case, used a special fertilization technique known as <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 4ksH4AIxYsBC86pHzNfwgp</span> or ICSI.</p><p>“ICSI is the more effective fertilization method when the male partner has a lower sperm count,” says Dr. Cooney. “Our embryologists find the best-looking single sperm from the male, which we inject into one of the retrieved eggs.” </p><p>Five days after fertilization, a second procedure is performed in which one of the Generations doctors -- Dr. Cooney, in this case -- implants the embryo back into the uterus. “In most cases, we transfer only a single embryo because a single baby is much safer with IVF than twins or triplets.” she says. Within two weeks, Ashley would learn if she was pregnant.</p><h3>Acting in a musical was a great distraction</h3><p>Understandably, IVF can be all-consuming at times. Couples who have poured their heart and soul into getting pregnant want nothing more than success. Wisely, Ashley distracted herself by getting a role in a community-theater musical called “A Good Old Fashioned Redneck Country Christmas.”</p><p>Ironically, the show’s final performance was scheduled the night before Ashley’s eggs were retrieved by Dr. Stanic. </p><p>“My husband gave me my last injection backstage during the show,” says Ashley. “By coincidence, there is a couple in the play that is trying to get pregnant.”</p><p>As the musical’s run ended, Christmas was just a few days away, so Ashley kept busy with holiday activities. She tried not to think too much about getting pregnant, until one day… </p><p>“I remember coming home just bawling like crazy,” Ashley says. Amid the flowing tears, she wailed, “I’m so sorry! I just can’t stop crying.”</p><h3>Ashley’s mom sensed success</h3><p>That was the moment when Ashley’s mother suspected that she might become a grandmother. </p><p>“Seeing me get so emotional, my mom just knew,” Ashley says.</p><p>On December 30, following one more trip to Madison for ultrasounds, Ashley’s mom was proven correct. </p><p>“It’s positive!” Ashley screamed after getting a phone call confirming her pregnancy. “We ran out, bought two pregnancy tests, used them, and gave one to my parents and one to Courtney’s parents. The next night was New Year’s Eve so we went out and celebrated. Of course I had to skip the champagne.”</p><p>Following her seven-week ultrasound, Ashley and Courtney took a long-planned family cruise to Montego Bay of Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Cozumel of Mexico. </p><p>“Not everyone would choose to go that far away, but after everything we went through, it seemed like a trip would be good for us,” Ashley said. “It turned out to be a great, relaxing vacation.”</p><h3>Finally, a baby</h3><p>Most of Ashley’s pregnancy was fairly routine, although about 9 days before her due date, Ashley’s labor had to be induced. At long last, Baby Riley was born on September 2, 2020.\r</p><p>“When I was pregnant, we played songs that would get the baby moving like ‘Jump Around’ or ‘Jambalaya’ (‘Goodbye, Joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh.’),” Ashley says. “The night she was born, I had nothing left and just couldn’t push anymore. My husband put the music on and our beautiful Riley was born just after midnight.”</p><p>Thinking back over the last decade, Ashley and Courtney are incredibly grateful for their treasured little girl, who turns six months old in March 2021. </p><p>“It was a long road, especially knowing that IVF might not even work,” Ashley says. “We are grateful to Dr. Cooney, Dr. Stanic and the Generations team for everything they did to make Riley possible. She is my everything!”</p><p>The Generations team could not be happier for the LaBeauses and countless other couples who have been able to grow their families. </p><p>Seeing couples like Ashley and Courtney grow their family after so many years of struggling is extraordinarily gratifying, adds Dr. Stanic. </p><p>“We live with these couples who have struggled for years trying to grow a family,” says Dr. Stanic. “Our team is here to listen, take things slowly and help educate our patients so they can make the smartest and safest decisions. We think this approach definitely enhances the chances of success.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>While the nation was in a state of shock over the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Ann Smitherman was beginning her own nightmare.</p><p>On that day, she started experiencing terrible abdominal pain that landed her in the emergency room. Doctors diagnosed her with polycystic kidney disease, an inherited disorder in which cysts form on the kidneys, causing them to lose function.\r\n\r\nAnn’s pain never went away. She tried to continue with her desk job in inventory control, but after a couple of years, she couldn’t function at work anymore. She and her husband, Tommy, and their two children struggled to get by as she fought for Social Security benefits, but in 2005, they lost their house in Texas and moved in with her brother in Bloomington, Minnesota. Ann, a U.S. Navy veteran, fought constant pain and depression the entire time.\r\n\r\nThen, in 2007, life dealt her another blow: Tommy died after suffering a heart attack in bed. Ann’s health continued to decline. She moved back and forth between Minnesota and Texas a couple more times, collecting an additional diagnosis of polycystic liver disease along the way. Because she is a veteran, Ann receives her health care at Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. The only possible cure for her health problems was a kidney and liver transplant, but her VA in Minnesota didn’t perform transplants. So, her doctors referred her to the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital and UW Health kidney and liver transplant programs in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nTransplant wasn’t a new concept for Ann and her family—her father also had polycystic kidney disease and had received a kidney transplant when she was young. Still, the idea scared her. After she came to Madison and underwent the required testing to go on the transplant wait list, she waited for a call saying it was her turn. But when she finally received that call—for a kidney and liver that was from an at-risk donor—she turned it down. “I was afraid of dying,” she says. “But after I got that first call, I realized what transplant entailed, and by the time I got a second call, I was ready.”\r\n\r\nUltimately, Ann would have to wait until her third call to receive the gift of life. After the second call, she flew to Madison, but due to technical challenges the doctors weren’t able to place adequate intravenous catheters prior to surgery and the transplant needed to be canceled. By the third call, however, the doctors had developed a novel strategy for working with her veins and were able to place the necessary catheters successfully. In May 2019, Ann received a new kidney and liver. \r\n\r\nBefore the transplant, Ann says, she looked like she was nine months pregnant. Afterward, the extra fluid went away—and so did her pain. She had the transplant at University Hospital in Madison and stayed in the intensive care unit there, then she finished her recovery at the VA hospital. “Everybody that cared for me was wonderful,” she says. “I couldn’t have been more pleased.”\r\n\r\nAnn is acutely aware of how fortunate she was to receive a second chance at life with her new organs. Two of her brothers also suffered from polycystic kidney disease, but they never had transplants. Both of them now have died. “Now, I am able to go about my day without being in pain,” Ann says. “I’m so glad I had this opportunity.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Even though two decades have passed since John Nelson gave part of his liver to his cousin, Cindy, he still becomes emotional when talking about it. His selfless act became an important part of his personal history, influencing the choices he makes and the causes he supports. </p><p>\rIt was an important part of the UW Health Transplant Center’s history, too. John was just the third living liver donor at University Hospital, and the program has gone on to expand and provide even more options for those who want to give the gift of life to others. Truly, over the course of those two decades, UW Health’s living liver donation program has changed dramatically. “I’m very proud to be part of their learning process,” says John, who lives in Jacksonville, Illinois.\r\n\r</p><h3>Pioneers\n\r</h3><p>Back in 2000, Cindy was suffering from hepatitis C and needed a liver transplant. Initially, she was working with a transplant center in Chicago, but transferred to UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, after an acquaintance told her of the high-quality program there. \r\n\r</p><p>John had read an article about a new option for living liver donation and asked Cindy’s caregivers at UW Health whether he might donate part of his liver to her. At the time, a living liver donation program didn’t exist in Madison, but surgeons there were currently working with their first donor. Cindy likely would have to wait as long as three years for a deceased donor liver, so John kept checking back, and by Christmas of 2000, surgeons at UW Health agreed to test him. He was a match, and they scheduled both his and Cindy’s surgeries for March. The pair would become only the second living liver donation in Madison. \r\n\r\n</p><div></div><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Cindy was ill the day of their surgery, so they had to reschedule for April 20, 2001, which made John the program’s third living liver donor. “I knew I was a pioneer,” he says. “I had friends who were concerned about the process and wanted to know how many times the surgeons had done this.” \r\n\r\nHe told his friends what his transplant coordinator told him: His surgeons had removed parts of a liver thousands of times, and they had performed hundreds of transplants. This was just the third time they combined those two processes.\r\n\r\nDuring their recoveries, nurses purposely situated John and Cindy at opposite ends of the transplant floor so they could practice their walking while visiting each other. “It was a wonderful bonding time for us,” says John. “Being able to spend time together helped with both of our recoveries.”</p><h3>\r\rA focus on living donors</h3><p>\rWhile UW Health continued to perform a few living liver transplants over the next several years, it didn’t start focusing on expanding the program until 2010. At that time, the UW Health Liver Program developed a dedicated donor team which would serve only the living donor. When John gave the gift of life, he had the same transplant coordinator as Cindy, but starting in 2010, donors and recipients each had their own coordinators. “We think of our living donors as being our patients and having the same level of priority as any other patient,” says Megan Spina, MSW, LCSW, living donor manager for the UW Health Transplant Center. “We ensure there are very strong boundaries in place that respect the donor’s decision-making process.” \r\n\r\nUW Health also started taking steps to make the donation process as easy as possible. For example, the program changed the order in which it was testing potential donors, taking images of their anatomy before proceeding with all the other tests, so they would know right away whether they were eligible to move forward in the process. The program also hired an internal medicine provider who would work exclusively with donors.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason caregivers wanted to pay special attention to living donors was because the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) was changing the way it allocated livers from deceased donors. UNOS wanted to make organ sharing more equitable, so livers went to the sickest people — regardless of where they lived in the nation. For states such as Wisconsin, in which the wait time for a liver had been shorter compared with other states, this meant it was much harder to get to the top of the wait list. Thus, living donation would be a quicker option for some transplant patients. \r\n\r\nJaime Myers, RN, MSN, CCTC, clinical director of the UW Health Transplant Center, compares the need for living donors to a pie. “When you don’t have enough pie for everyone, you can change how you give out the pieces, or you can get more pie,” she says. “We need more pie, which in this case is livers.”\r\n\r</p><h3>Organ donation’s biggest cheerleader</h3><p>\rWhile UW Health has been changing how it serves living liver donors, John has undergone his own journey. Unfortunately, Cindy died about a year and a half after her transplant because of complications with hepatitis C. Complications that, through more time and research, are now avoidable. “It was very difficult,” he says, “because when she died, a part of me died, too. But I’m grateful she was able to live with a clearer mind after her transplant. It truly did help her.”\r\n\r\nJohn became active in the organ donation movement, volunteering for his local organ procurement organization and acting as a living donor advocate. When he trained to become a hospital chaplain, he chose organ donation chaplaincy as his special project. He spent a week on University Hospital’s transplant floor, talking with doctors, nurses and other staff about their lifesaving work.\r\n\r\nNow a retired chaplain, he takes every opportunity to talk about the importance of organ donation. “It’s such an incredible gift that you can give another person,” he says.\r\n\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>At first, Erica Dill didn’t worry about a little bump on her baby’s head.</p><p>“Our pediatrician didn’t want to alarm me,” says Erica, a single mother from Brooklyn, Wisconsin. “She just thought it would be good to have it checked out,” she says.\n\nPaige Dill was just 3½ months old when Erica brought her baby girl to UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison in late 2014. There, Paige was closely examined by Pediatric Neurosurgeon Bermans Iskandar, MD, and Pediatric Plastic Surgeon Delora Mount, MD. \n\nDr. Iskandar and Dr. Mount immediately recognized that Paige had sagittal craniosynostosis, referring to a condition affecting about 1 in 2,500 newborns.  \n\n“The head of these newborns does not form properly because the bones on top of the skull fuse together too soon, preventing the head from expanding side to side,” says Dr. Iskandar. “The skull at this age is nowhere near solid bone, so this anomaly causes the head to become long and skinny from front to back.” he says. “The only way to correct this deformity is by doing surgery to separate the fused bones, which frees up the skull to gradually assume its normal shape.” </p><p>Erica, understandably, was shocked by this diagnosis. She was also fearful about the idea of her little girl having invasive surgery on her head. Compounding her stress was the failing health of her stepfather, Mitchell Compton, who, at age 50, was dying of cancer at the time. </p><h3>Lot of tears</h3><p><b>\n</b>“There were a lot of tears,” she recalls. “I thought I might have done something wrong during Paige’s delivery. I was also anxious about the surgeons having to drill into Paige’s head, but they assured me this is something they see regularly, and it is something that would not be noticeable once corrected. \n\nEven more comforting for Erica was hearing that Paige was a good candidate for the endoscopic form of surgery, a minimally invasive alternative to conventional open surgery.</p><p>“Endoscopic surgery has the best chance of success in babies like Paige who are less than 6 months old,” says Dr. Mount. “It also results in less risk, a much smaller scar and faster recovery than open surgery. She is one of many children who have been treated endoscopically with great success at American Family Children’s Hospital.”</p><h3>Paige did great in surgery</h3><p>Paige’s surgery went very smoothly. Within just a few weeks, her head began to assume a more rounded shape. </p><p>“She spent three nights in the hospital and recovered amazingly well,” says Erica. “We had to keep her home for a month to be sure her head did not get jostled, but then she was able to go back to day care.”</p><p>Today, Paige is a spunky 5-year-old with a personality Erica likes to call just a bit <i>sassy</i>.</p><p>“Every other day, she has a new best friend,” says Erica. “I just can’t figure out where she gets the sassiness.”</p><p>Having had time to reflect on the experience, Erica recalls being overwhelmed by the emotions of five years ago.</p><p>“My stepfather died in January 2015, just 11 days after Paige’s surgery,” she says. “It was hard seeing him pass away so young. He lived just long enough to see Paige get through the surgery, but I feel his spirit with me every day.”</p><p>Erica also won’t forget her co-workers at the UW Health Radiology clinic at 1 S. Park St. in Madison, who collected more than $1,000 to help cover Paige’s medical bills.</p><p>“My co-workers have been so great, especially with me being a single parent,” says Erica. “Paige got such wonderful care, and she just went to her last checkup with Dr. Iskandar and Dr. Mount who said they don’t need to see her anymore. That was a nice way to start 2020.”\n\n\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Entrepreneur and philanthropist Pleasant Rowland is successful on many fronts. She founded Pleasant Company (now American Girl), created a learning system that has taught two generations of children to read and has a passion for supporting the arts and historic renovation projects.</p><p>\rBut, by 2012, after two decades of living with chronic kidney disease, Pleasant found herself in a dire situation that required immediate attention. Blood tests indicated that she was in Stage 4 kidney failure. Dr. Micah Chan, her nephrologist, told her that her kidneys were performing at about 15 percent and she needed to start dialysis or receive a kidney transplant.\r</p><p>Pleasant came to UW Health to consult with Dr. Dixon Kaufman, medical director of the UW Health Transplant Center, one of the world’s foremost transplant centers. She asked him, “If I was your mom, what would you recommend?” His answer was decisive. “You need a transplant,” he said, “and soon.”\r</p><p>After family members were tested, Pleasant learned that none were a good match, so she wrote a letter “to everyone I knew,” says Pleasant. In it she explained that she had been living with kidney disease for years and because of the progression of the disease, needed a transplant within two months. “Never did I think I would be writing a letter with a request of such gravity,” she wrote. “If this is something you cannot do for any of a multitude of reasons, please know that I will love you no less.”\r</p><p>She was stunned when she learned that a number of people volunteered to donate. “I don’t know who all these people are,’’ says Pleasant, “and due to how the process works, I may never know.”\r</p><p>Pleasant quickly penned a second letter to her friends to share her gratitude. “I write today to tell all of you who have written or called or held me in your thoughts and prayers, how humbled and deeply grateful I am. To all of you I send my love and thanks beyond words. Never ever did I think there would be such an expression of caring and concern as has poured forth in the last ten days.”\r</p><p>After testing was complete, two people were found to be good matches. Within weeks, Dr. Kaufman was transplanting the donated kidney. Pleasant very gratefully received her gift of life and left the hospital two days later. She could already feel her energy returning. “This was a miracle to me,’’ she says. “I was blessed to live so close to a world-renowned transplant center.”\r</p><p>Pleasant continued her care under the careful watch of her transplant nurse coordinators, Leah Madden and Rebecca Dillis, and the expertise of Dr. Arjang (Aji) Djamali, chief of nephrology. As she recovered, they got her through a few bumps in the road and Dr. Djamali worked to modify her immunosuppression to get the best function from her new kidney. Her care team will support her throughout her transplant journey.\r</p><p>Through her gratitude for her gift of life, Pleasant was inspired to give a gift to others who come to the UW Health Transplant Center seeking a second chance at life.  \r</p><p>Her $10 million gift will support the creation of the Pleasant T. Rowland Transplant Clinic, which will be located near the main entrance of University Hospital. The new location will allow for easier access, significantly expand clinical space to reduce the need for patients to travel within University Hospital for associated services, improve technology and add features to increase patient comfort.\r</p><p>This gift is her way of thanking organ donors, their families and her care team at UW Health. “I’ve seen firsthand how the UW Health Transplant Center offers a second chance at life,” says Pleasant. “Life after transplant is wonderful.”\r</p><p>Pleasant feels especially thankful for the remarkable care team that helped her on her journey. “This is my gift to others who face the same challenges I did and to the world class transplant team at University Hospital,” says Pleasant.\r</p><p>To people with kidney disease who may hesitate to ask friends and family to consider being a living donor, she has this advice: “This is no time to be shy.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Any aspiring doctor will tell you that medical school is a long, difficult journey—even under the best of circumstances.</p><p>But for Nathan Baggett, graduating from medical school was almost a herculean feat, given the fact that he was struggling with liver disease and underwent three liver transplants in less than two years. Still, he accomplished his goal and now is serving a residency in emergency medicine in Minnesota—all thanks to the care he received from his doctors and friends at the UW Health Liver Transplant Program in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nNathan, 31, first became sick at age 20 with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a rare liver disease that damages the bile ducts. Despite his medical problems, he graduated from college, worked as a firefighter and paramedic in Ankeny, Iowa, and backpacked around the world. “I tried to take advantage of the good moments,” he says.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, he and his girlfriend, Ann, moved to Madison so he could attend the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. He transferred his care to the team at UW Health, who treated his infections and performed procedures to open his bile ducts. There is no cure for PSC; most patients eventually need a liver transplant, but Nathan’s caregivers hoped he would be able to finish medical school before reaching that step. \r\n\r\nIn July 2015, he became much sicker, so his doctors added him to the wait list for a new liver. That summer, he and Ann got married and miraculously, he was able to return to medical school and his specialty rotations in the fall. “All the while, I was turning yellow from jaundice,” he says, “and I lost 20 to 30 pounds. I would go into the hospital at 5 a.m. to rotate with the surgery team. Then, at 4 p.m., I would go to the infusion center for plasma therapy for a few hours, go home, sleep, and then do it all over again the next day.”\r\n\r\nDuring Nathan’s fourth year of medical school, while all his peers were applying for residencies, he and his doctors decided he should try to find a living liver donor. His cousin volunteered, and in March 2017, she gave him the gift of life with a new liver. The plan was that he would undergo the transplant, take a year off to recover and then resume his medical training. But a few days after his surgery, the artery that supplies blood to the liver clotted, damaging his new liver and causing his health to deteriorate rapidly. Meanwhile, his peers chose him to give the commencement speech at his medical school graduation, which he delivered from a chair while some of his UW Health transplant surgeons cheered him on in the audience.\r\n\r\nIn July 2017, he received his second liver transplant from a deceased donor. He spent that fall applying to surgical residencies, but by spring 2018, he was experiencing problems with his new liver again. “My doctors decided the best thing they could do to save my life was add me to the transplant list again,” he says.\r\n\r\nYet again, his career as a doctor would have to wait.\r\n\r\nIn September 2018, Nathan received his third transplant. Although he initially had complications with that liver too, miraculously, he pulled through and his liver is now functioning normally. Slowly but surely over the next couple of years, he gained his strength back. “I went from not being able to walk to the corner of the block to going on hikes,” he says.\r\n\r\nHikes aren’t the only joy in his life these days—in February 2021, he and Ann welcomed a baby girl, Lucy. “It’s the gift of life, full circle,” he says. “The three donors who kept me alive made her possible for us.”\r\n\r\nAnd now that his health has stabilized, he feels ready to continue on his journey to become a doctor. “Now I can start to think about returning to things that mattered most to me,” he says. “It’s a little nerve-wracking to think about leaving Madison, because the doctors here have seen me through the hardest times in my life. But I’m excited about what the future holds.” \r\n\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Dorothy Perpich was 71 when she began a long voyage that deeply touched her heart, both physically and emotionally.</p><p>Now 82, Dorothy’s health is better than she ever imagined, thanks in large part to a battery-powered blood-pump device called an LVAD that UW Health doctors implanted in her chest several years ago. Today, Dorothy’s blood flows as freely as her spirits — but the journey getting to this point included several challenging hurdles.</p><p>It was June 2010 when Dorothy’s husband Bill was diagnosed with a fatal lung disease known as advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The next day, Dorothy learned that she had breast cancer. Mortality was very quickly staring this couple — married for 47 years — right in the face.</p><p>“It was a shocking time,” Dorothy said. “Fortunately, we had tremendous support from our children, our friends and our church to help cushion the blow.”\r</p><p>Bill’s condition deteriorated over the next six months while Dorothy underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation to treat her cancer. Sadly, in January 2011, just two weeks after she finished her radiation therapy, Bill passed away.</p><p>On the heels of losing her husband and her own exhaustive cancer treatment, Dorothy had to start putting one foot in front of the other without her lifelong partner. It turns out, however, that another medical storm was brewing for Dorothy, who — until her cancer diagnosis — was an active, healthy woman and an avid doubles tennis player.</p><p>“Not long before Bill died, I started losing stamina,” Dorothy said. “At first, it wasn’t much, but in time, it got to the point where I’d have to catch my breath after simply walking across the lawn.&quot;</p><h3>Left heart failure diagnosis was a surprise\r</h3><p>A mother of five and grandmother of 10 from De Pere, Wis,, Dorothy was ultimately diagnosed with left heart failure by a Green Bay cardiologist, Kendra Marsh-Kates, MD, of Prevea Health, known as “Dr. Marsh.”</p><p>“Dorothy was not a smoker and did not have a family history of heart disease,” Dr. Marsh said. “When our testing revealed no artery blockages or problems with heart function, we concluded that Dorothy’s weakening heart was essentially a side effect from one of her chemotherapy treatments.” </p><p>For the next five years, Dr. Marsh treated Dorothy with medication and, in time, a pacemaker to regulate her heartbeat. Unfortunately, Dorothy’s heart  never rallied back to normal. She kept getting weaker, so Dr. Marsh called upon her colleagues from the UW Health Heart Failure team who regularly travel from Madison to Green Bay to provide care for those living in the Fox Valley.\r</p><h3>Not ready to give up</h3><p>“At 75, Dorothy had reached end-stage heart failure, but she wasn’t ready to give up,” said Dr. Marsh. “Heart transplant – one option for end-stage heart failure – wasn’t an option because transplants are rarely done on patients older than 70.”</p><p>After consulting with the UW Health cardiology team, Dr. Marsh arranged for Dorothy to be flown by helicopter to Madison for immediate evaluation.</p><p>“Fortunately, we had another option for Dorothy known as an LVAD, or a left ventricular assist device,&quot; said <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9500</span>, MD, director of the UW Health Heart Failure team. &quot;It was Dorothy’s last resort, but we felt strongly it could give her several years of better-quality life.”\r</p><p>The LVAD, a surgically implanted battery-powered pump, takes over the job of the weakened left ventricle by continuously pumping blood through the aorta and out to the body. Although ventricular assist devices were first introduced in the 1960s, LVAD implantations became more widespread over the past 20 years. \r</p><p>Historically, LVAD’s were given to heart failure patients as a “bridge” to transplant, allowing them more time until a new heart became available. As the devices have gotten smaller, more durable and easier to implant, an increasing number of patients have received an LVAD permanently — something cardiologists describe as “destination therapy.” UW Health, in fact, is a leading regional LVAD implantation site and one of just three places where this procedure is done in Wisconsin.</p><p>“The current generation of LVADs has been very well received by patients,” Dr. Dhingra said. “About 75 percent of destination therapy patients are still living after two years with an LVAD, and many are living much longer.”\r</p><p>Although Dorothy was down to her final option for more life, she didn’t exactly jump at the opportunity when she first laid eyes on the LVAD.</p><p>“I was not sure I wanted that thing inside of me, but the chances were far greater I would live longer and better so I went ahead,” she said. On Oct. 27, 2015, Dorothy was taken to the operating room and the LVAD was implanted.</p><p>At the time, a cardiothoracic surgeon had to cut her breastbone open (similar to a heart bypass operation) to implant the device. Today, however, most patients have the procedure performed less invasively, resulting in reduced pain and faster recovery. Again, UW Health is a leader in providing this less invasive option.</p><p>Part of the LVAD — namely the control unit and battery pack — exists outside of the body. Most patients carry these small components around in a fanny pack or shoulder bag.</p><blockquote><p>I just can’t say enough about the UW Health team,” Dorothy said. “Along with my friends, family and faith, the doctors and nurses there have been so caring and supportive.</p></blockquote><p>More than five years have passed since Dorothy’s LVAD was implanted. In fact, following another hospitalization in Madison beginning in February 2021, Dorothy was given the option of stopping the LVAD because of the likelihood that her heart was now strong enough to pump without assistance. She agreed to try disconnecting the LVAD and thankfully, her heart has been working fine on its own.</p><p>Now 82, Dorothy is filled with spirit, joy and incredibly grateful to be alive. COVID-19 limited her usual volunteer work, yoga classes and gym workouts, but Dorothy still gets in plenty of walks and sees her adult children frequently. She also looks forward to resuming her cross-country travels with three women friends — an endeavor Dorothy jokingly refers to as the “Antique Roadshow.”</p><p>“Considering that she was at end-stage heart failure at 75, seeing Dorothy doing so well today at 82 is incredibly rewarding,” Dr. Marsh said. “Our experience working with the UW Health team has been tremendous and Dorothy is a living illustration of this partnership.”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>To say that Carson Schmudlach’s teen years got off to a rough start would be quite the understatement.</p><p>Shortly before turning 13, Carson started vomiting and getting dizzy. Eventually, he became confused. He experienced tingling on one side of his body and other symptoms that felt like heat stroke.</p><p>After he was mistakenly diagnosed with acid reflux, vertigo and migraine headaches, a psychiatric nutritionist wondered whether it was “all in his head.” The irony of those words would ring too true soon enough.</p><p>Not long after the start of 8th grade, Carson, then 14, became even more confused. He couldn’t recall his own name. His balance was out of whack, and he had to grab on to furniture or railings to avoid falling.  </p><p>After first being seen at a UW Health facility closer to the family’s home in Lodi, Wis., Carson was rushed to the Emergency Department at American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison.</p><p>Initially, doctors were stumped. Carson’s mother, Norma Jean Schmudlach, would not leave the Emergency Room until something more was done.</p><h3>Mom knew something was wrong</h3><p>“I know there is something wrong,” she said.</p><p>Ultimately, a CT scan was performed, and Norma Jean’s parental instinct proved correct. Pediatric Emergency Medicine specialist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8166</span>, MD, poked his head in the room.</p><p>“Can I speak with you both outside?” Dr. Kim said to Carson’s parents.</p><p>Norma Jean gulped as she and her husband Bill were informed that their son had a large brain tumor called a medulloblastoma. Located in the cerebellum – the part of the brain that controls balance, coordination and other complex motor functions – the tumor had begun spreading into Carson’s spine as well as into the pathways where brain fluid flows. Carson would need to have surgery the next day – the first of three surgical procedures over the next nine days.</p><p>“The tumor blocked the normal flow of brain fluid, causing significant fluid buildup that increased pressure on Carson’s brain, making him very sick,” said <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10630</span>, MD, a UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon. “Our first job was to relieve that pressure by taking him to surgery and creating a new fluid pathway. This let us keep Carson safe as we prepared him for a second surgery, when we would remove most of the tumor.”</p><p><span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7193</span>, MD, Carson’s UW Health pediatric hematologist/oncologist, said at this point, the medical and neurosurgical teams had a better sense of how to proceed, which they discussed in depth with Carson’s family</p><p>“Carson had a rough road ahead of him, but he has been incredibly strong throughout his journey,” she said.</p><h3>Surgery, followed by a four-month hospitalization</h3><p>Two days later, Dr. Stadler removed most of Carson&#39;s tumor, leaving behind only a small portion that would not have been safe to resect. Unfortunately, many patients – including Carson – develop a condition called Posterior Fossa Syndrome after this kind of surgery. Symptoms resemble those of a stroke, and in Carson’s case, it meant he had to re-learn how to breathe, walk, talk, eat and control his muscles.</p><p>For a time, Carson needed a tracheostomy tube to help him breathe and a feeding tube because he could not swallow food. He also had a third brain surgery in which Dr. Stadler placed a shunt in his head to drain any excess brain fluid that might build up. Moreover, Carson’s autism, initially diagnosed at age 3, added even more names to the list of pediatric specialists who were caring for him.</p><p>“Carson’s been seen by just about every specialty except gynecology,” said Norma Jean, who maintains a sense of humor despite the weight of the situation. For four months following his tumor surgery, Carson never left the hospital. Norma Jean saw the outdoors just once – for a few hours – for a quick trip home to grab some new clothes.</p><p>On Jan. 10, 2019 – his 121st day in the hospital – Carson was finally discharged. He endured 31 radiation treatments and still returned for several two-night hospitalizations to receive maintenance chemotherapy, which ended in May 2019.</p><p>Carson’s sense of humor was among many things that helped him get through this incredibly long hospitalization.</p><p>“On his last day of radiation,” Child Life Specialist Katie Markowski said, “his parents and I pranked the radiation staff by hiding a whoopie cushion under his bed. Just before they moved him to the radiation table, Carson popped the whoopie cushion, giving everyone a great laugh while celebrating his last radiation treatment.”</p><h3>Good news is better when the doctor sings</h3><p>Every MRI scan brings anxious moments, but when the results are good, Carson and his family love nothing better than hearing it from his oncologist, Dr. Puccetti, who can’t help bursting into song when she has good results to share.</p><p>The situation goes like this:</p><p>Norma Jean’s phone rings. She answers with the usual, “Hello.”</p><p>“I’m singing! I’m dancing! And yes, I’m smiling!” Dr. Puccetti said on the other end of the call with a lilt in her voice.</p><p>“The moment I hear those words,” Norma Jean said, “I start crying tears of joy because I know Carson’s cancer didn’t grow.”</p><p>For Carson and his family, every day that his cancer remains stable is both a blessing and a gift.</p><p>“It’s hard dealing with the unknown, but we just go with it,” Norma Jean said. “We take what we have and just keep making memories.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Ever since he was a child, Peter Gee has enjoyed taking items apart and putting them back together.</p><p>He did so as a mechanic in the Air Force in his early 20s, and then again when he opened his own business, Pete’s Full Service Storage, where he maintains, repairs and stores boats. But when Pete started suffering from gastrointestinal problems, he had to depend on the transplant surgeons in the UW Health Liver Transplant Program to do the fixing.\r\n\r\nPeter, now 63, first began feeling sick about six years ago. His gastroenterologist spent a year trying to figure out what was wrong, finally diagnosing him with ascites—a buildup of fluid in the belly, often due to severe liver disease. Peter’s belly was becoming so big that he could barely breathe, and interventional radiologists at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, started draining the fluid every few months.\r\n\r\nPeter had three lesions on his liver and needed a liver transplant, so his doctors put him on the transplant wait list at University Hospital, also in Madison. “Of course, the transplant list is long, and the number of livers available is short,” says Peter. “So, I ended up having to wait about two years before my name came up. During that time, I just kept on coming to the hospital to have my belly drained.”\r\n\r\nBecause he knew his wait would be long, Peter volunteered to be a standby liver recipient. That meant if there was a liver that was a match for him and someone else was ahead of him in line, he still would come to the hospital in case the surgery didn’t go through for the other patient. It was a long shot, but he figured it was worth the drive from his home in Rome, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nOn August 17, 2020, he received a call that he was second in line for a liver. He traveled to University Hospital and waited, thinking he probably would need to go back home. But then a nurse came in and told him to get ready for surgery. It was finally his turn. “It was the most miraculous thing I have ever experienced in my lifetime,” he says. “The surgeon told me the liver looked like it was made for me.”\r\n\r\nPeter stayed in the University Hospital intensive care unit for about a week, then spent the rest of his recovery in the veterans’ hospital. At both hospitals, he said, his care was fantastic. “I can’t say enough about all the people who cared for me,” he says. “I fell in love with all of them, and I think they fell in love with me, too.”\r\n\r\nHe is now back in Rome, cutting his own firewood and walking a couple miles every day. He has connected with his donor’s sister and learned that he was a man in his 50s who looked very much like Peter.\r\n\r\nPeter now talks about his gift of life with anyone who will listen, including the customers at his store, where he’s been busy with the start of a new boating season. “My friends have all told me I look 1,000 percent better,” he says.\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>For years, Whitney Blakely suffered from a disease for which her local doctors didn’t have a name.</p><p>The Rockford, Illinois woman first noticed symptoms of inflammation and hand weakness when she was 18; three years later, she tested positive for systemic lupus. She then began what became six months of steroid treatment, and at the end of that time, tests showed she no longer had the disease.</p><p>Except she wasn’t really cured. She continued to experience symptoms on and off, but doctors didn’t feel comfortable treating her for something the tests did not support. “It became a game of cat and mouse,” says Whitney, now 34. “The symptoms persisted, my insurance changed, I saw a different doctor, the doctor couldn’t find anything wrong with me, and I repeated the whole cycle again.”</p><p>When Whitney was in her late 20s, she married her husband, Cornel, and at age 30, she began undergoing fertility treatments. She was having trouble carrying babies to term—she had lost a total of four pregnancies in the first trimester. When the fertility clinic performed genetic testing prior to treatment, it discovered she had lupus anticoagulant, an immunoglobin that can cause an increase in inappropriate \rblood clotting. She still underwent a cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF), but during the stimulation portion of the treatment, she started experiencing lung issues. She saw a pulmonologist in Rockford who eventually sent her to UW Health in Madison.\r\n\r\nThe UW Health pulmonologist immediately referred Whitney to a rheumatologist, and after just one appointment, the rheumatologist confirmed that she still had systemic lupus. Whitney began seeing Tripti Singh, MD, nephrologist at UW Health, who ordered a kidney biopsy and discovered that Whitney was in Stage 4 lupus nephritis. That meant she was nearly in kidney failure. “At that point, I was actually feeling relieved that I finally had a diagnosis,” says Whitney. “It explained why I was always tired.”\r\n\r\nDr. Singh began treating Whitney with several different medications, including mycophenolate, an immunosuppressant, and prednisone, a corticosteroid used to treat immune system disorders. Slowly, Whitney’s kidneys stabilized, and her symptoms became more manageable. \r\n\r\nHer fertility, however, was a different story. Her fertility doctor suspected she had difficulty staying pregnant either because the lupus identified the baby as a foreign body and attacked it, or because she had been forming blood clots near the implantation site. Whatever the reason, Dr. Singh did not believe it was a good idea for Whitney to become pregnant again because of the medications she was taking. “I appreciate it when doctors are straightforward with me,” says Whitney. So, she and her husband went a different route: They found a gestational surrogate, who became pregnant after one round of IVF, and on Sept. 26, 2018, Caelum Blakely was born.\r\n\r</p><p>When the UW Health Lupus Clinic opened late in 2018, Whitney began seeing her doctors there. “I am able to manage my symptoms now,” she says, “but due to 10 years of not being treated, I have joint and nerve damage. I appreciate that it’s a one-stop shop, since I’m traveling from Rockford.”\r\n\r\nAs she strives to stay healthy in order to care for her infant son, Whitney says she is grateful for the care she found at UW Health. “I truly feel the medical staff at UW Health got me where I am today,” she says.</p><p><b>Update:</b> Whitney&#39;s family expanded when she delivered a healthy baby boy in November 2020. &quot;The Lupus Nephritis team participated in the care of my pregnancy and it was their lab work and help that kept me safe,&quot; says Whitney. &quot;My boy and I may not be here without them and I&#39;m forever grateful!&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>A 50th wedding anniversary is a highly momentous occasion for any couple, but for Jim and Michelle Schmaling of Whitewater, WI, reaching their golden anniversary on April 13, 2021 was extraordinarily meaningful.\n\r\nAbout five months earlier, Jim and Michelle were out walking their dogs one early November afternoon when Jim, now 73, suddenly started to lag behind his wife.\n\r\n“Are you ok?” asked Michelle, after looking back at her husband.\n\r\n“I’m not going to make it,” was Jim’s frightening reply. Michelle was further alarmed when Jim could not follow her directions to look to his left.\n\r\nMichelle didn’t realize it right away, but Jim was having a stroke. A large clot in the back of his head was interrupting the flow of blood to the brain, killing millions of neurons each minute and putting Jim’s quality of his life in great jeopardy.\n\r\nInstinctively, Michelle called 911 right away – a simple but life-saving act that set the stage for a series of events that ultimately led to Jim’s amazing recovery.\n\r\nNikki Storm, the Schmaling’s younger daughter, happened to be working that afternoon in the Emergency Room at Fort Memorial Hospital in Fort Atkinson, just 10 miles from Jim and Michelle’s home.\n\r\n“My co-worker Carole handed me the phone, saying it was my mom,” says Nikki, a health unit coordinator in the ER. “Mom was frantic and out of breath and said my dad was coming to our hospital in an ambulance  because he suddenly became disoriented and could not follow her instructions.”\n\r</p><h3>Daughter immediately suspected a stroke\n\r</h3><p>Working in an ER, Nikki immediately suspected a stroke, alerting everyone who needed to know that her dad’s ambulance would arrive shortly. Doctors, nurses, imaging technicians and other staff prepared accordingly to ensure no moment was wasted.\n\r\nFort Health Care emergency physician Eric Snell, D.O., met Jim at the door. After observing and examining Jim, Dr. Snell agreed that a Level I stroke was almost certainly the diagnosis. Due to COVID-19 hospital visitation restrictions, Michelle had been keeping in touch from home. (That very month, Jim and Michelle both tested positive for COVID about two weeks apart.)\n\r\nBrain scans made Jim’s stroke diagnosis official. As not much time had elapsed since his first symptoms, Jim was eligible for a clot-busting intravenous treatment called alteplase or TPA.  \r\nSeeing how large Jim’s clot was, Dr. Snell called UW Med Flight, knowing that UW Health – one of just five comprehensive stroke centers in Wisconsin – offered the highest level of medical resources to treat Jim. With Med Flight on the way, Michelle and her other daughter, Laurie Wilson, hopped in the car for the short drive to Fort Atkinson so they could watch Jim’s flight take off for Madison.\n\r\nJust before he was taken from the Emergency Room to the helipad, Jim looked at Nikki, who took her father’s hand.\n\r\n“Dad, you’re in good hands,” she said. “They’re going to take good care of you.”\n\r\nJim’s speech was slurred, but three words came out in return: “I love you.” Nikki darted across the street to meet up with her mom and sister. All three had lumps in their throat as the Med Flight helicopter whisked Jim into the sky.\n\r</p><h3>“I knew he’d get excellent care at UW”\n\r</h3><p>“It wasn’t easy watching him go, because I’d no longer be with him,” Nikki says, “Still, I knew he’d get excellent care at UW.”\n\r\nAnother good sign, Nikki thought, was learning that the Med Flight physician flying with her dad, Dr. Wade Woelfle, was someone she knew through work.\n\r\n“Dr. Woelfle works mostly for UW Med Flight, but he also works part-time at our ER here in Fort Atkinson,” Nikki says. “He and I have worked several night shifts together, which made the whole situation more comforting.”\n\r\nTriggered by Dr. Snell’s call from Fort Atkinson to Madison, UW Health’s stroke team prepared immediately for the likelihood that Jim would undergo a mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally-invasive clot-removing procedure performed by a team consisting of a neurosurgeon, anesthesiologist and an endovascular physician, nurse and technician, among others.\n\r\nFortunately, Jim remained stable during the 13-minute flight to Madison, staying awake and lucid enough to understand everything Dr. Woelfle or the Med Flight nurse said. By 4 pm, the helicopter had landed at University Hospital, where Jim was wheeled into the Emergency Department.\n\r\nKnowing that Jim had a large brain clot, UW Health physicians ordered CT perfusion imaging, which shows how much of the brain is damaged and how much can be saved.\n\r\n“Most of Jim’s brain was still looking good,” says UW Health neurosurgeon Azam Ahmed, MD. “Given the size and location of his clot, we moved ahead with the mechanical thrombectomy. Similar to a cardiac catheterization, we go in through the femoral artery in the groin, guiding a small catheter and instruments through the arteries until we reach the brain,” says Dr. Ahmed. “Once we reach the right place, we ‘fish’ the clot out,” he says. “It’s like using a stent on a stick.”\n\r\nThe procedure was over shortly after 6 pm, and Michelle was back in Whitewater as the UW Health team repeatedly updated her by phone.\n\r</p><h3>Great relief after clot was removed\n\r</h3><p>“The nurses were awesome,” says Michelle. “Once they told me the clot was out and Jim was doing OK after the procedure, I felt a great sense of relief,” she says. “Once he was in a room, the nurses took all my calls and answered all my questions.”\n\r\nJim spent the next four days recovering at University Hospital. On Thanksgiving 2020, he was transferred to UW Health’s Rehabilitation Hospital in Madison for nine more days of physical, occupational and speech therapy. Aside from some vision disturbance in his left eye that ultimately resolved, Jim was doing quite well by the time he came home in early December. He has no memory of the stroke or the four days in the hospital, but nobody considers that a bad thing.\n\r\n“Most patients improve after we perform a thrombectomy,” says Dr. Ahmed. “About half of them – including Jim – recover dramatically. They arrive in a bad way, unable to speak or move on one side. A few days later, they walk out of the hospital. It’s kind of a Lazarus-like procedure, and when you see people like Jim leave functionally independent, you know you’ve done some good for someone that day.”\n\r\nDr. Justin Sattin, a UW Health neurologist who took the original call from the Fort Atkinson hospital, says the entire process worked like a well-oiled machine.\n\r</p><h3>Time is the greatest enemy\n\r</h3><p>“When it comes to strokes, UW Health’s system of care really stands out,” says Dr. Sattin. “Time is out greatest enemy, and we are set up to jump into action on several fronts. Our Access Center, Med Flight team, Emergency Department, our ability to share images among hospitals and our ability to use video to observe and communicate with some of our distantly-located patients all contribute to this capability. Each piece is vital to the task of getting people like Jim here as safely and quickly as possible so Dr. Ahmed and his colleagues can do their amazing work.”\n\r\nJim’s case also illustrates how valuable people like his wife, Michelle, are to preserving a stroke victim’s quality of life. As soon as she knew something was wrong, she didn’t flinch.\r\n“Sadly, some people don’t call 911 the way Michelle did,” says Dr. Sattin. With a stroke, there simply is no time to wait it out, sleep it off or even call your primary care doctor. Millions of brain cells die each minute and they cannot be brought back, so recognizing stroke signs and symptoms is absolutely critical to preserving the patient’s ability to function independently.”\r\nLess than two months after coming home from the Rehabilitation Hospital, Jim returned to work. With his vision fully recovered, he also was able to resume driving by April 2021.\r\n\r\n“He is back to his usual joking self,” says his daughter, Nikki. “To remember how he looked the day of the stroke and see him now, you really wouldn’t have a clue that anything happened.”\n\r\nFor a couple that just celebrated 50 years of marriage, no material gift could exceed the value of Jim’s remarkable recovery from a major scare just five months earlier. \r\n“We are extremely lucky to reach this great milestone together, knowing that the outcome could have been very different,” says Michelle. “We have so many people both at Fort Memorial and UW Health to thank for making this such a happy occasion.”\r</p><p>\r</p><div></div><p></p><p></p>",

      "story": "<p>If you were shocked that Hollywood star Luke Perry could have a fatal stroke at age 52, meet Emily Miller, who was just 28 years old when she suffered a stroke.</p><p>She&#39;s part of a growing number of younger people who have suffered an ischemic stroke, which happens when a blood clot travels to the brain and blocks the blood flow. About 10 percent of stroke patients are under 50. Some of them share the same risk factors that cause stroke in older people: type 1 diabetes, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity and high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nOthers, like Emily, have rarer conditions that can cause an ischemic stroke. In Emily&#39;s case, an undiagnosed hole in her heart allowed a blood clot to travel to her brain.\r\n\r\nBut none of that was known when Emily suddenly developed a terrible headache while working in the box office at the Coronado Performing Arts Center in Rockford, Ill. When she started to lose consciousness, her co-workers saved her life by calling 911.\r\n\r\nShe was taken by ambulance to SwedishAmerican Hospital, where a CAT scan showed the problem and Emily received a dose of the clot-dissolving drug tPA (tissue Plasminogen activator).\r\n\r\nWhen her parents, Kevin and Cathy McDermott, arrived at the emergency department, Emily was still unresponsive. Cathy remembers being taken to a closed room, and a doctor showing her a scan and telling her that her newly married daughter had suffered a major stroke.\r\n\r\n&quot;It was the worst moment of my life, it was so scary,&quot; she said. &quot;Emily had her head struck to the left, her eyes weren&#39;t responsive, she couldn&#39;t speak and the whole right side of her body was paralyzed.&quot;\r\n\r\nDoctors decided to airlift Emily to University Hospital in Madison in anticipation that she may need neurosurgery. When she arrived, however, surgery was no longer needed, the tPA had restored blood flow. She began her recovery in the Neuro ICU, where her parents and husband Austin soon joined her.\r\n\r</p><p>&quot;It was incredible,&quot; her mother said. &quot;Within a few days, she was up and walking. Her doctor was amazed.&quot;\r\n\r\nHer stroke neurologist, Dr. Erik Tarula, explained that the degree of injury demonstrated by the MRI was much more extensive than her symptoms would have suggested.\r\n\r\n&quot;Emily is an example of how we treat the person, not the image,&quot; he says. &quot;She was very lucky to recover from a stroke this serious.&quot;\r\n\r\nEmily would move to the intermediate care ward of the hospital, and then on to the UW Health Rehabilitation Hospital, where her workout partners could have been her grandparents. In addition to speech therapy, she walked every day, worked out at a gym, planted a huge garden with her husband, Austin, and threw a surprise engagement party for her sister. Her mom is in awe of how hard Emily worked to get better from &quot;this greatest challenge of her young life.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;She faced each day of her recovery with determination to do what she needed to get better,&quot; Cathy McDermott says. &quot;Her positive attitude, along with the care of excellent doctors, and prayers and support from friends and family, all contributed to her recovery.&quot;\r\n\r\nEmily returned to University Hospital last summer, so that cardiologist Dr. Amish Raval could repair her heart. Dr. Raval says the condition is called a patent foramen ovale (PFO), a hole between the upper chambers of the heart. This hole exists in everyone while in utero, but in about 75 percent of people, the hole closes soon after birth.\r\n\r\nAn ischemic stroke can occur if a clot develops in a vein, a fragment breaks off, travels up to the heart, across the hole and up to the brain. If there were no hole, the clot would only travel to the lungs, where a small clot would be unnoticed. However, a small clot in the brain results in a stroke.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the risk of future strokes, Ravel threaded a small device through a catheter into the heart. This &quot;double umbrella, PFO-closure device&quot; sealed the hole, reducing Emily&#39;s chances of a future stroke.\r\n\r\nDr. Tarula adds that not every hole in the heart needs to be sealed. Since this type of hole in the heart is present in one out of every five people, he says, we cannot simply assume that this is the problem. A complete workup looking for other stroke causes along with a detailed look at the architecture of the heart is needed before referring someone for a procedure. The goal is to make sure the right people get the right intervention.\r\n\r\nAs Emily began to recover, she wanted to give back and help other families, like hers, who suddenly find themselves spending days and nights at the Neuro ICU.\r\n\r\nShe asked for donations from friends and family instead of Christmas gifts, and used the donations to assemble &quot;comfort kits&quot; for other patient families.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of her stroke, she, Austin and her parents arrived at the hospital with 48 kits, filled with tissues, toothbrushes, toothpaste, a blanket, coloring books, notepads, crayons and snacks. Things to make life a little easier for others.\r\n\r\nShe made the rounds, chatting with other families who were in the same scary situation as her family was a year before.\r\n\r</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s so great that she can give hope to other families and show them what is possible after a stroke,&quot; says Dr. Tarula. &quot;The kits are also a wonderful way to give back and help others.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>Jennifer Gardner is celebrated World Stroke Day by being back at work at the University of Wisconsin Law School.</p><p>Doesn’t sound that exciting? Well, consider that almost exactly a month earlier, the 47-year-old accountant suffered a major stroke while walking up Bascom Hill for a meeting in Bascom Hall.\r\n\r\nHers is a story of good fortune, and nearly everyone (except maybe her) doing the right thing.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that went right was that Jennifer was at work at all. Normally on Friday, she works from home in rural Rock County. Her husband of less than a year, Don Brokmeier, had plans to go hunting, so she would have been home alone.\r\n\r\n“I started feeling dizzy when I was walking up the hill, and when I got to Bascom, I was confused and couldn’t find the room,’’ she remembers. “On the way back down, I had another dizzy spell and had to hang onto a railing. I had drool coming out of one side of my mouth and I tried to talk and couldn’t understand myself.”\r\n\r\nShe pulled out her smart phone and Googled “stroke symptoms” because she didn’t want to bother anyone to help her. On her way back to her office she called her husband, she said, “He couldn’t understand me at all. So I got scared and hung up the phone.”\r\n\r\nWhen she got back to the law school, she thought she’d go back to her office, shut the door and rest.\r\n\r\nLuckily, co-worker Adam Bushcott noticed something seemed off.\r\n\r\n“He asked me if I was okay, and I answered him that I was dizzy, so he told me to sit down, to smile and noticed that one side of my face was drooping,’’ she said. “He said, ‘Wait here,’ and went to get Kelly.”\r\n\r\nCo-worker Kelly Hallmark had a family member who suffered a stroke recently, and she recognized the symptoms immediately. She instructed Bushcott to dial 911 while trying to keep Jennifer calm by continuing to ask her questions. A third co-worker, Vicky Coulter arrived and tried to keep Jennifer calm by letting her know she was going to be okay. Coulter spoke with UW Police, and went outside to wait for the ambulance.\r\n\r\nWhile they waited, Jennifer wanted to call her husband, so Hallmark got on the phone, and explained that Jennifer was likely having a stroke. He got in the car and raced towards Madison as Jennifer was on her way to University Hospital in an ambulance.\r\n\r\nThere, she had a brain scan and was evaluated by stroke neurologist Dr. Natalie Wheeler. Jennifer remembers being asked questions and walking into the wall when she tried to walk.\r\n\r\n“The scariest thing was that I knew everything that was going on, but I couldn’t communicate,’’ she says.\r\n\r\n\rDr. Niemann displays a device used to mechanically retrieve clots.\r\n\r\nShe was given the clot-busting drug tPA, which can only be given within the first three hours after most strokes. A picture of the blood vessels inside her brain showed the blockage that caused her symptoms. Wheeler contacted neurosurgeon Dr. David Niemann, who agreed it might be possible to remove the clot mechanically, using a procedure called &#39;thrombectomy.&#39; \r\n\r\nNiemann threaded a device up the blood vessels from the thigh to the brain, and was successful in grabbing and removing the clot. This restored blood flow to the brain and saved Jennifer’s brain cells.\r\n\r\nJennifer figures she had the stroke about 1:15 p.m. and was at the hospital before 2 p.m. By late afternoon, she was sitting up in bed and talking normally.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Don, served with the Whitewater Fire Department for many years, and knows how fortunate she is.\r\n\r\n“I’ve transported many people over the years who were having strokes, and it usually doesn’t turn out this good.”\r\n\r\nTorrie Wepfer, NP, who took care of Jennifer in the hospital and saw her last week in the outpatient clinic, attributes her strong recovery to getting to the hospital in time.\r\n\r\n&quot;She got here in ‘the golden hour,’ &quot; Wepfer says. “As we say in stroke, time equals brain cells.”\r\n\r\nAnd Jennifer’s advice to others?\r\n\r\n“Don’t Google it,’’ she says. “Just call 911.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>After living with digestive problems for his entire adult life, Jason Roman finally reached a point in 2019 where he needed to take the next step—a liver transplant.</p><p>The Waukesha, Wisconsin man was on the wait list for a new liver at a Milwaukee hospital, but his insurance company recommended he secure a spot on the wait list with at least one additional hospital to improve his chances of receiving a liver. Jason underwent testing with UW Health at their Waukesha, Wisconsin liver transplant clinic location and received his gift of life at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. “I had a feeling UW Health was going to be the place where it happened,” he says now.\r\n\r\nWhen Jason was 20, he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease. He spent the next 10 years battling the disease, and when he was 30 and applying for additional life insurance, the nurse who performed his health screening recommended he seek treatment for liver disease. The hepatologist he saw diagnosed him with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a disease of the bile ducts. At age 33, he needed to have his colon removed, and he continued to have problems until he was placed on the Milwaukee hospital’s wait list in 2015. At the time, he was inactive, which meant he wasn’t officially ill enough to receive a new organ, but if his condition suddenly worsened, he could be ready to be activated right away. That next step occurred in early 2019—Jason’s skin and eyes were turning yellow, and he was having to undergo ultraviolet light therapy three times a week.\r\n\r\nJason and his wife, Meg, chose UW Health for their dual listing because they already had met some of the doctors there when they sought a second opinion about his colon removal. “At the time, we were very impressed with the doctors, staff and facility,” says Jason. “We instantly knew we would be well taken care of there.”\r\n\r\nHe received the call he had been waiting for in July 2020 when a well-matched liver  become available. He and Meg called friends to care for their teenage daughter, Ryleigh, and then they drove to Madison for his transplant surgery. Because visitors in the hospital were restricted due to COVID-19, Meg tailgated out of the back of their car in the parking lot during Jason’s surgery. He was in the hospital for nine days, then returned home to Waukesha to finish his recovery.\r\n\r\nNow, he is back to working from home full time in his job as an engineer at GE Healthcare, and Ryleigh is attending school virtually until the family can receive vaccinations for the coronavirus. “After 20-some years of battling my health, I’m finally back to what I feel is normal,” Jason says.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Just a few weeks after much of the nation shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Christian and Sarah Schartner’s 2-month-old son, Calvin, became very ill.</p><p>Only an hour after Calvin’s pediatrician ordered laboratory tests to figure out what was wrong, he directed them to head immediately to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C692</span> in Madison, Wisconsin. Calvin was in acute liver failure.</p><p>The next few days were a blur as the Schartners juggled finding emergency care for Calvin’s 2-year-old brother, Clayton, in the middle of a pandemic and trying to digest the dire news their doctors were giving them. Calvin needed a liver transplant. He was so sick he jumped right to the top of the transplant wait list. But because it was April 2020 and the pandemic- at that time- had dramatically reduced organ donation, it was going to be extremely difficult to find a deceased donor for him. “We were confined to Calvin’s little room in the hospital,” says Sarah, “trying to cherish every moment we could, because we didn’t know if our son was going to die.”</p><p>As Calvin’s health rapidly declined, doctors at the UW Health Liver Transplant Program recommended the Schartners try to find a living liver donor. Neither Christian nor Sarah qualified. Christian was too large to donate even a part of his liver to an infant, and Sarah had recently given birth. So, they put out a request on Facebook—and were stunned when more than 200 applicants wanted to be considered. “The transplant team was screening applicants around the clock,” says Sarah.</p><p>Then, at the end of April, the Schartners received word that a liver from a deceased donor was a perfect match for Calvin. He received the gift of life on April 27, taking the first step on a long road to healing and growing.</p><p>Over the course of Calvin’s illness and recovery, he was in the hospital for seven weeks. During that time, Christian and Sarah formed strong bonds with the caring staff at AFCH, especially Calvin’s liver transplant team including his nurses in the PICU and on the 5th floor, his nutritionist, his transplant nurse coordinator Beth Gerndt-Spaith, his transplant hepatologist Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11326</span>, medical director of liver transplantation and his surgeon and surgical director of liver transplantation, Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5806</span>. “The team we worked with felt like family to us,” says Sarah. “They were by our sides around the clock. I felt like they were on top of his case and fighting for him.”</p><p>Now, the Schartners are back to living their lives—but very carefully. In addition to managing his medications and becoming his caregivers at home in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, they must be careful to keep the coronavirus out of their household. Because Calvin is immunocompromised, the illness could be fatal for him. They take great precautions in their jobs—Sarah as a 2nd grade teacher and Christian as a Realtor.</p><p>They are especially grateful for all the support they have received—from neighbors who have organized meals for them, to strangers who offered to pay for flights if they found a living donor, to other parents whose children have had liver transplants and reached out. “There’s overwhelming love and support in this world,” says Sarah.</p><p>And in the meantime, Calvin is busy becoming the person he is supposed to be. “He’s a very chatty little boy who adores his big brother,” says Sarah. “I feel like we finally get to enjoy having a baby in our house, and not just have to worry about all his medical needs.” </p>",

Or anything related to medical procedures that might result in something sharp contacting her skin.</p><p>So when Annika, at age 13, underwent a kidney transplant at <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L169</span> in Madison, Wisconsin, the entire process was very hard on her. But the doctors, nurses and child life specialists at the hospital made a huge difference for the teen throughout her treatment, taking extra care to comfort her as she made her way through an incredibly difficult time. “They were all really accommodating of a teenager’s feelings,” says her dad, Sam.</p><p>Annika’s health problems began in February 2020, when her parents learned she was anemic after a school physical. They changed her diet and gave her some iron pills, but she continued suffering from more and more bloody noses and was tired all the time. On March 15, her bloody nose was severe enough that they took her to the local emergency room in their hometown of Rockford, Illinois. Doctors there quickly determined she was in kidney failure and needed to see a nephrologist. The Wyants chose American Family Children’s Hospital for Annika’s care, and her mother, Janna, rode with her there in the ambulance. “Looking back at it, we know she was close to death that night,” says Sam.</p><p>In Madison, UW Health doctors educated the Wyants about kidney failure and what they needed to do to help her. First, they had to clean her blood through dialysis, starting at the hospital and then continuing at home. Then, they needed to prepare her for a kidney transplant, which would be the only way to get her on the road to recovery.</p><p>Both of Annika’s parents underwent testing to be living kidney donors and, remarkably, both were matches. Because Janna was a slightly better match, she prepared to donate her kidney to her daughter. “There was no doubt that one of us was going to do it,” says Janna. “I was concerned, but I knew it had to happen.”</p><p>Annika and Janna underwent their transplant surgeries on October 7. Annika responded well to Janna’s gift of life, and she has spent the school year healing and trying to stay away from other people to protect herself from the coronavirus. Now 14, Annika loves reading, art and spending time with her dog, goats and chickens, and she’s looking forward to the day when she can join her classmates in person again. “Other than the boredom of isolation, she’s much more herself than she has been in more than a year,” says Sam. “She’s cracking jokes again.”</p><p>And as for those pesky needles at the hospital? Annika’s nurses have done everything they can to make her feel more comfortable—and it’s worked. “I still don’t like IVs,” Annika says, “but blood draws are OK now.”</p>",

She spent 25 years in law enforcement and switched careers to surround herself with students as an associate dean at Waukesha County Technical College.</p><p>\rThen she got sick. She was treated for bronchitis and pneumonia, but it never seemed to end. “I went from riding 50 miles a week on my bike to gasping for air and needing oxygen to survive,” says Jennifer. A simple walk across campus made it difficult for her to breathe, but Jennifer fought on and continued to pursue her dreams. “I don’t give up and I don’t let adversity stop me from achieving my goals,” says Jennifer. Those dreams came true in the form of a new career offer and Jennifer became a professor and program director of the accelerated degree program for returning adults at Wisconsin Lutheran College.</p><p>\rBut she continued to struggle with her health. After years of testing at another hospital she was diagnosed with pulmonary veno occlusive disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. She learned she needed a lung transplant to survive.

When Bill, his ex-wife, and his two daughters met with David Foley, MD, transplant surgeon at UW Health, Dr. Foley told them the only way Bill could avoid continual recurrence was to undergo a liver transplant. After receiving that news, all Bill could think about was his family. He didn’t want to be a burden for his daughters, who were both pregnant with their first children. A transplant, he feared, would mean he could never be the kind of grandpa he had always dreamed of becoming.\r\n\r\nInstead, the gift of life became his saving grace. Bill received a liver transplant on September 14, 2013. Two weeks after the surgery, he walked one of his daughters down the aisle at her wedding. In the years since then, Bill has discovered that, with his new liver, there are no limits to what he can do. “When I had the first operation to remove part of my liver, I had no energy,” he says. “I thought, well, this is how it’s going to be for the rest of my life. When I had the transplant, it was just the opposite. I’m 75, and I feel like I’m 50.”\r\n\r\nBill retired from his job as a salesman in 2018 and uses his newfound free time to hang out with his grandchildren. He likes taking his grandson to baseball games, and he drives from Portage to Verona, Wisconsin, to pick up two of his grandchildren from school several days each week. He visits the health club every morning, and as he works out, he thinks about his donor, who saved his life. He is determined to take good care of his body so he can continue to make use of his new liver.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I have to pinch myself because I never thought I would be able to do all that I am doing,” he says. “I know I have a good story, and I hope it gives others hope.”\r\n</p>",

He never could have dreamed he eventually would receive the gift of life more than 1,000 miles away in Madison, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nJoe learned he suffered from liver disease in summer 2019. While doctors tried various medications to treat his condition, it soon became clear that a transplant was his only option. As time went on, he began experiencing cognitive decline, a low energy level and debilitating cramps at night. Even if he had been able to get on the wait list for a liver transplant, he knew he likely would wait a long time at his hospital in New England.\r\n\r\nBut serendipity turned his situation around. His wife, Janet, was talking to a friend whose brother needed a transplant several years ago. The brother grew up with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8080</span>, MD, a transplant surgeon at the UW Health Liver Transplant Program. The friend connected Joe and Janet with her brother, who in turn put them in touch with Dr. Foley. By then, it was the end of May, and UW Health had started running tests for transplant patients again. Dr. Foley suggested that Joe travel to Wisconsin to be assessed for transplant there. “This is where our love affair with UW Health began,” says Joe. \r\n\r\nThe Murrays came to Madison right after Memorial Day and were able to get on the wait list. Caregivers at UW Health suggested they remain in Wisconsin to wait for a new liver, because Joe’s health had deteriorated. They stayed in a couple of hotels, then found an apartment in Middleton, Wisconsin, where they settled in to wait. On July 8, Joe received a call at 3 in the morning that a liver had become available, and they headed to the hospital to accept his long-awaited gift.\r\n\r\nJoe, Janet and their 15-year-old daughter Katie (they have two other children who are in their 20s) stayed in Madison all summer. Katie began her sophomore year of high school attending classes remotely from Wisconsin, and Joe and Janet established friendships with other residents of their apartment building, including a UW Health nurse. “Neither of us had ever lived in the Midwest,” says Joe. “We both loved it there. When it was time for us to leave in October, it was very hard for us because such an amazing thing had happened in Wisconsin.”\r\n\r\nThe Murray family returned home on October 16 and were greeted by a socially distanced group of friends and neighbors in their driveway. Since then, Joe has continued with his medical care closer to home, but he still keeps in close contact with many of the caregivers with whom he connected while in Madison. “I felt like the luckiest person on the planet even before I received the transplant,” he says. “My care at UW Health was outstanding. You put your life in the hands of people who are strangers at first, but you end up depending on them just as you would depend on the closest of family members.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>While playing hockey for Notre Dame in the 1960s, Daniel Ferguson took plenty of hard falls on the ice. Aside from some nasty bumps and bruises, however, Dan never experienced anything since that could be called a health scare.</p><p>He continued leading a healthy lifestyle well into his 70s by swimming, bicycling or running almost daily and competing in close to 20 triathlons since he turned 60.</p><p>Something unusual surfaced when Dan, now 76, an engineering education professor at Purdue University, and his wife Rene (rhymes with “teeny”) were vacationing at their summer home in northern Michigan in July 2019. </p><p>“I noticed Dan’s face was drooping on the left side,” Rene said. At first, she thought Dan had a stroke, but after getting it checked out by a neurosurgeon who did a CT scan and an MRI at a northern Michigan hospital, Dan couldn’t believe the news. </p><p>“The doctor’s last name was Strait, and believe me, he gave it to me straight,” Dan said. “The MRI showed I had a very aggressive brain tumor. The doctor said I had one to 12 months to live.”</p><p>Life suddenly turned into a tsunami for the Fergusons. Dan and Rene told their three children, who helped relieve Rene with insurance company navigation, meal preparation and other vital tasks. Once they got past the shock, they sought out the best medical team they could find. Unfortunately, a neurosurgeon in Indianapolis – a little more than an hour&#39;s drive from the Fergusons’ primary residence in West Lafayette, Ind. – couldn’t offer much hope.</p><p>“The Indianapolis neurosurgeon wouldn’t operate because he felt the location of my tumor in the region of my brain called the insula made surgery too risky,” Dan says. “He offered to do a biopsy and then refer me for radiation and chemotherapy, but I wanted the tumor removed.”</p><h3>Daughter&#39;s connection with UW Health neurosurgeon proves key</h3><p>Fortunately, the Fergusons&#39; younger adult daughter, Julia, recalled that a close friend from graduate school at UW-Madison, Kara Dempsey, is related to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5850</span>, MD, who is the chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.</p><p>&quot;Julia’s connection with Dr. Dempsey’s family was a glimmer of light,&quot; Rene said. &quot;Dan and I had never met Dr. Dempsey when the girls were in school together, but not long after Dan&#39;s diagnosis, we spoke with him by phone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dr. Dempsey didn’t mince words,&quot; Dan said. &quot;He said, &#39;If anyone in my family had a tumor like this, I would send them to one person to remove it.&#39; &quot;</p><p>That individual was his colleague, UW Health neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5472</span>, MD. </p><p>&quot;Dr. Dempsey said that Dr. Baskaya is one of the leading neurosurgeons for this kind of tumor,&quot; Dan said. &quot;Rene and I decided immediately to come to Madison.&quot;</p><p>Just two weeks after learning of his startling diagnosis – technically known as glioblastoma multiforme or grade IV astrocytoma – Dan was taken to the operating room at UW Health’s University Hospital.</p><p>That day, July 19, 2019, Dr. Baskaya spent more than 6 hours resecting every bit of Dan’s tumor that was visible on his MRI. Working with advanced patient safety technologies such as intraoperative MRI, high-tech surgical microscopes with special dyes, subcortical stimulator and motor-evoked potential recording, Dr. Baskaya was able to achieve gross total removal of the tumor without damaging parts of the brain that control Dan’s motor skills. </p><p>&quot;Dan had a very good result with the surgery,&quot; Dr. Baskaya said. &quot;At the same time, this is a deadly brain cancer that often comes back. Dan&#39;s only chance at longer survival – and the best possible quality of life – is to have someone with extensive experience remove the tumor gross totally, which is what we did without compromising motor function.&quot;</p><p>Just five days after surgery, Dan was discharged from the hospital, but given how far the Fergusons were from home, Dan and Rene stayed in Madison for the next two weeks of recovery. They easily made themselves &quot;at home&quot; in a room at the Best Western Plus Inn Towner, just a few blocks from University Hospital.</p><h3>Despite long travel, Dan opts for follow-up at UW Health</h3><p>Given the aggressive nature of Dan’s disease, courses of radiation and chemotherapy would soon begin. He could have started both treatments closer to home, but Dan was so pleased with his surgical care at UW Health that he decided to come back to Madison for radiation therapy with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6356</span>, MD, and oncology care with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7284</span>, MD.</p><p>&quot;Long car trips are nothing new for us,&quot; said Dan, noting that the Fergusons regularly drive more than 400 miles each way between West Lafayette and their northern Michigan cabin. &quot;Even though I could no longer drive after surgery because of the risk of a future seizure, Rene didn’t mind the driving. We were so impressed with the quality of care at UW Hospital that we felt it was worth the trip.&quot;</p><p>Fifteen radiation treatments – five days a week for three weeks – concluded in September, but they took a toll on Dan’s energy level. For someone used to being so physically active, the loss of stamina was frustrating. He also lost 15 pounds because of a loss of appetite.</p><p>“I didn’t have much &#39;get up and go,&#39; &quot; Dan said. &quot;But whenever I could, we found our way to several Madison parks and conservation areas for walking, and the time outside really helped break up the days living at the hotel.&quot;</p><p>With radiation completed, Dan slowly began to perk up. In early November, he began taking double-dose chemotherapy – in pill form – six days each month for six months. Just before that, he also started using a new, FDA-approved glioblastoma treatment called Optune, a wearable, portable battery-powered device that delivers electrical tumor treating fields through small arrays that are taped to the top and sides of Dan’s newly shaved head. Based on results from clinical studies, Optune can extend the life expectancy for glioblastoma patients by sending electronic signals that disrupt the formation of more cancer cells in the brain without affecting healthy cells.</p><h3>New battery-powered device may disrupt cancer cell growth</h3><p>“The Optune device is about 9 inches square, weighs 3½ pounds and fits in a neat shoulder bag or backpack which goes with me everywhere,&quot; Dan said. &quot;I have it connected 20 to 22 hours a day. It’s not clear how much it will extend my life, but the clinical studies are promising, so I’m more than willing to try it.&quot;</p><p>An engineer by trade, Dan spent most of his life immersing himself in data and details. There are times, however, when he prefers not to know every aspect about his disease and the odds of it coming back. </p><p>&quot;You’ve heard of &#39;TMI?&#39; &quot; Dan said, referring to the popular acronym standing for &#39;Too Much Information.&#39; &quot;My code abbreviation for information overload is &#39;TMMI,&#39; meaning &#39;Too Much Medical Information.&#39; &quot;</p><p>He also has made several dietary changes – no added sugars, plenty of protein and other healthy foods – aimed at keeping the cancer at bay. &quot;General Rene&quot; – a name her brother gave her in fun – happily takes charge of Dan&#39;s medicines, diet and transportation needs. She juggles the kind offers of help from friends and family members. Above all, Rene&#39;s undying love and support for her husband of 51 years is truly a joy to behold.</p><p>&quot;As wonderful as the doctors and this hospital have been, I have no doubt that the care my wife is giving me is every bit as vital,&quot; Dan said. &quot;I am so grateful to her, my children and our friends, and I firmly believe that patients lucky enough to have this kind of support will have better outcomes.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>After nearly 20 years of experiencing peaks and valleys in his heart health, Howard Marg had grown accustomed to changing his behavior depending on how his heart was feeling. Then, in 2013, his health plummeted. </p><p>After experiencing pneumonia, then a stroke, Howard needed a more permanent solution to his heart problems. That solution turned out to be the gift of life—he received a heart transplant at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, on November 23, 2013. “My new heart hasn’t missed a beat and just keeps right on ticking,” says Howard, who lives in Auburndale, Wisconsin.</p><p>Howard’s challenges began in 1995, when he was afflicted by coxsackie B virus, which caused his white blood cells to attack the left ventricle of his heart. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure but was able to manage it through medication. When he encountered “valleys” in his health, he simply rested more and took time to recover.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re going to be in a situation like this, you want the best people around you. And I did.</p></blockquote><p>After Howard caught pneumonia early in 2002, he sought care at his local hospital in Marshfield, Wisconsin, before deciding he needed to be evaluated for a heart transplant at University Hospital. He was quite weak the morning he and his wife, Deb, left for Madison, and suffered a stroke on the way there. Deb brought him directly to the emergency room at University Hospital, where doctors administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a drug that dissolves the blood clot causing the stroke. “University Hospital was the place I needed to be,” says Howard. </p><p>After several weeks of working hard to recover, Howard improved his health enough that he no longer needed a heart transplant, and he returned home. For the next 11 years, he returned to his familiar pattern of peaks and valleys, managing his care through his local primary care physician.</p><p>But eventually, his health declined again. In October 2013, he felt so weak while hunting in the woods that he laid down and took a nap on the ground. Afterward, he made it to his truck and Deb again took him to the emergency room at University Hospital. This time, doctors installed a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a mechanical pump implanted inside the chest to help pump blood. He felt great—for a while-- but less than a month later, he was back at the hospital with a heart full of fluid.</p><p>Howard was placed on the heart transplant wait list, and within a day, a heart became available for him. “I can never forget how the team at University Hospital responded,” says Howard. “From X-ray technicians to nurses to doctors, everyone was in my room getting me ready for surgery right away.”</p><p>Now, six years after his life-saving transplant, Howard experiences the occasional health problem, but he’s grateful for every day. “If you’re going to be in a situation like this, you want the best people around you,” he says. “And I did.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Sabrina Bernhard was a typical 13-year-old girl who came home from school one day complaining of intense abdominal pain in November 2016.</p><p>“I thought it was probably her appendix,” said Sabrina’s mom, Tammy Bernhard of Lomira, Wis. “We took her to the emergency room in Fond du Lac, about 15 miles away, and they did an appendectomy.” </p><p>It seemed like all was fine, but just three days later, Sabrina woke up with a fever. After going back to the hospital, things started to slowly spiral downward. The pathology report on Sabrina’s appendix suggested she had Crohn’s disease — an incurable, often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease of the digestive tract that can cause intense pain, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Confirmation of Crohn’s disease came very quickly.</p><p>After doctors in Fond du Lac consulted with UW Health pediatric gastroenterologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9585</span>, Sabrina was transported to American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison, where she was found to have an abdominal abscess — a pocket of infected fluid — that was causing severe pain.</p><h3>Infected fluids were drained</h3><p>A procedure was performed the next day to drain the infected fluid out of Sabrina&#39;s abdomen — a step to prevent contamination of her bloodstream. Drains were inserted to keep the fluid flowing out of her body.</p><p>After a two-week stay in the hospital, Sabrina went home. While she was skittish about it at first, Tammy was trained how to empty and clean the drains and intravenous tubes that her daughter needed to keep infected fluid moving out of her body.</p><p>“She had to go everywhere with the drains and I.V. tubes,&quot; Tammy said. &quot;Fortunately, her clothes hid the tubing, but we had to be very careful that she didn’t bump into things or let the lines catch on something.&quot;</p><p>Once the infection was under control, Dr. O&#39;Connell began treating Sabrina with Humira, a powerful biologic drug for patients with severe Crohn’s disease that is given via self injection.</p><p>Sadly, over the first half of 2017, Sabrina experienced repeated abdominal flare-ups and the Bernhards got to know every bump in the road between Lomira and Madison as they made several multiple-day trips to American Family Children’s Hospital.</p><p>“When Sabrina got hit with severe stomach pain, we drove her straight to Madison,” Tammy said. “Her intestine would get highly inflamed, leading to bowel obstructions. She was hospitalized several times over six months, with each stay lasting about four or five days.”</p><h3>Worst pain ever was scary</h3><p>As debilitating as her condition was, nothing matched the pain Sabrina suffered one day in July 2017.</p><p>&quot;She couldn’t walk or even get in the car,&quot; Tammy said. &quot;One ambulance drove her part way to Madison and then another intercepted and took her the rest of the way. It was very scary.&quot;</p><p>At the hospital, doctors saw signs of a developing fistula, or tunnel that can form between organs that are normally not connected. Sabrina also had a stricture or narrowing of her large intestine that prevented waste from getting through.</p><p>&quot;Sabrina could not eat anything through her mouth,&quot; Tammy said. &quot;All her nutrition was given intravenously. Her quality of life was not good.&quot;</p><p>Finally, after one more trip home and back, Sabrina&#39;s medical team agreed the time had come for more aggressive treatment — specifically surgery.  </p><p>Dr. O’Connell and the pediatric gastroenterology team consulted with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9677</span>, MD, a UW Health colorectal surgeon, and surgery was scheduled for late July.</p><h3>Surgery removed piece of bowel</h3><p>“We removed the affected loop of Sabrina’s bowel and then reconnected the two normal ends,&quot; Dr. Carchman said. “She has plenty of bowel remaining to live a normal life while her Crohn’s disease is managed with medication.”</p><p>As she reflects on her inpatient stays, Sabrina’s memories of American Family Children’s Hospital are far from unpleasant.</p><p>“They kept me busy enough with visits to the outdoor hospital healing garden or Child Life staff letting me shoot paint through a syringe at UW Badger football and hockey players,” Sabrina said. “I didn’t spend lots of time pitying myself.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, Sabrina has done very well for the past 2½ years, with no flare-ups or hospitalizations.</p><p>Now 16 and a high school junior, Sabrina — like many children who spend a lot of time in the hospital — has matured well beyond her years.</p><h3>Experience might impact career choice</h3><p>“Teenagers are so self-conscious about almost anything, but this experience helped Sabrina really appreciate what matters in life,&quot; Tammy said. &quot;She missed a lot of school and social events when she wasn’t feeling well, but is extremely appreciative of the care she received – so much so that she – and her older sister, Samantha – are thinking of pursuing a career in the healthcare field.&quot;</p><p>Dr. O’Connell, who sees many children and teens limited by gastrointestinal distress, is thrilled to see Sabrina active in school activities such as volleyball, track, pep band and yearbook.</p><p>“When you have seen someone like Sabrina at their low point, it is very satisfying to help them achieve a more normal quality of life,&quot; he says. &quot;Our goal is to help these kids pursue the same kinds of travel, college or career plans as their friends without disease. Moreover, Sabrina’s recovery has no doubt been fueled by a highly engaged and supportive family, which means everything in these situations.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>“Running” and “cystic fibrosis (CF)” aren’t often used in the same sentence—primarily because CF is a progressive disease that limits a person’s ability to breathe, and running is, well, running. But Brad Gardner of Spring Grove, Illinois, who was first diagnosed with CF at the age of 4 months, ran both cross country and track in high school.</p><p>He was able to stay relatively healthy until his junior year in college, when his condition deteriorated so that he could barely walk to class, much less run.\r\n\r\nYet Brad, 22, still managed to attend all his classes at University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point that year. “I just took the elevator rather than taking the stairs,” he says. But since he’s a fisheries and water resources major, he has to spend lots of time outside and his classes are very physical. By the end of the school year, his doctors were recommending that he take the next year off. It was time for the next big step. He and his parents came to Madison to undergo testing at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 14098</span>, and in October 2019, he was placed on the wait list for a new set of lungs.\r\n\r\nBy that time, he had gotten very sick and was in the hospital because his oxygen levels were quite low. The sicker a patient is, the higher he is on the list, and so Brad only had to wait six days for a set of lungs to become available. “Of course, the day I got the call was the day my mom wasn’t there,” he says. “I was a little bit overwhelmed, but my parents got out of work and came right away.”\r\n\r\nBrad’s lung transplant was on October 15, 2019. He had to spend the next several months relearning how to be an active person again—for a few weeks, he was so weak he couldn’t even walk up the stairs. Over the course of the next year, he gradually built up his strength until he was ready to return to school in fall 2020.\r\n\r\nOf course, the coronavirus pandemic meant that school was very different from when he had last been there. Most of his classes are online now, and there are only six people in his one in-person class. He lives alone in an apartment, and when he’s not studying, he plays piano, draws and runs. He will graduate in May 2021 and hopes to find a job working for the Department of Natural Resources.\r\n\r\n“I had a great experience with my transplant,” he says. “I can now run again, which feels really good. I can basically do whatever I want.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Mark Graff doesn’t own a crystal ball, but 30 years ago, he and his siblings received a glimpse into the future that few people have—a gene test that showed five out of the seven of them carried the gene for cardiomyopathy, a disease that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.</p><p>They underwent the testing after an older cousin started experiencing serious heart problems. And that’s how it came to be that Mark, at age 22, knew he was at great risk for life-threatening heart disease.\r\n\r\nFor nearly three decades, Mark and his siblings took precautionary measures to prepare for the inevitable as they watched their older family members—including their father and his siblings—succumb to the disease. Even though he had no symptoms, Mark received a pacemaker in 2009 and underwent the whole gamut of tests annually. Then, in 2018, he finally started experiencing extreme exhaustion and shortness of breath. By 2019, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10964</span>, cardiologist with the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 14085</span>, diagnosed Mark with congestive heart failure. Ultimately, Dr. Raza said, Mark would need a heart transplant.\r\n\r\nFor Mark, it was a call to action. He had watched his father—who also had cardiomyopathy—struggle with changes in medications and challenges with breathing during his last five years, and he was eager to try something that would give him a longer life than his dad. “This was an opportunity that I took willingly,” he says. “I welcomed it with open arms. I want to live!”\r\n\r\nMark was put on the wait list for a new heart at the UW Health Heart Transplant Program in February 2020. On May 13, he received a call that a heart had become available, but it turned out it was not viable. The next day, which was May 14, 2020, he got another offer for a heart—this time, it was a Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) heart. DCD is an option for organ donation for patients with severe brain injuries whose families have decided to remove all life-sustaining treatment. Once their heart permanently stops beating, they have experienced circulatory death and could be eligible for organ donation. UW Health has been a national leader in offering DCD organs, thus increasing the number of organs that can provide life-saving transplants. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving his new heart, Mark was in the hospital for three weeks. When he came back home, he was weak, but day by day he grew stronger. In August 2020, he returned to his job as a water distribution supervisor in the city of LaCrosse, and a couple months later, he resumed his beloved pastime of deer hunting. He has also been supporting his siblings as they undergo their heart disease journey. His sister, Sandy, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 6E1ZGkBbZThSIrNUK00sVp</span> at UW Health in September 2020 after he recommended that she pursue getting on the wait list there.\r\n\r\nMark’s recovery is still ongoing as he works hard lifting weights and eating healthy foods. But he’s incredibly grateful that he has a new heart as he moves forward. “There’s a road ahead of me yet with a few issues to manage,” he says. “But I’m lucky. I keep living my life day by day.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Bryson Yanke, 15, had been struggling for years with poor quality of sleep.</p><p>Especially during the last two years, he found it difficult at times just to stay awake during the day. Falling asleep in school or at a doctor’s appointment became more commonplace, thanks to the contribution of his obstructive sleep apnea – a condition defined by frequent sleep interruptions resulting from intermittent blockages to the airway.</p><p>Born with Down syndrome (or Trisomy 21), Bryson is one of the approximately four in five children with Down syndrome who also experience sleep apnea. A narrower airway – usually associated with Down syndrome – is more prone to obstruction, especially when the tongue slides back during sleep. With constant interruptions during the night, the child often wakes up sleep-deprived before the day even begins. For Bryson and his family, a cure for his poor sleep seemed elusive.</p><p>Adopted at age 4 by Jill and Dave Yanke of Cottage Grove, Wisconsin, Bryson underwent several sleep studies at <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: C719</span> in Madison, a sleep clinic and laboratory run by UW Health and UnityPoint Health – Meriter. His first sleep study at age 7 – which involves spending the night hooked up to equipment that monitors sleep quality – was inconclusive. Several more studies were done, but the sleep apnea only intensified. By age 11, another approach -- orthodontia work – was tried. Although this improves sleep for some children, it didn’t help Bryson.  </p><p>Finally, at 14, Bryson returned for one more sleep study that ultimately set the stage for a different path that led to brighter light at the end of the tunnel.  </p><p>“The bad news from the last study was that Bryson’s sleep apnea seemed more definitive,” says UW pediatric sleep specialist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6833</span>. “The good news was that our colleagues in pediatric ENT (ear, nose and throat) at American Family Children’s Hospital were ready and willing to help.”</p><h3><b>Surgery seen as possible solution</b></h3><p>After he was seen at UW Health’s pediatric ENT clinic, Bryson was deemed a candidate for a three-pronged surgery that had never been performed all at once in Madison. The procedure, which was done in January 2021, included a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (to identify the obstructed areas) followed by removal of the lingual tonsil tissue from the back of the tongue, and ended with a wedge glossectomy to remove a section of tongue muscle.</p><p>“We were able to carefully target Bryson’s obstructed airway and safely remove enough tongue tissue to significantly improve his breathing without compromising swallowing function,” says <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11465</span>, a UW Health pediatric otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat surgeon) who performed the operation. “Bryson now sleeps better and, more importantly, is more alert during the day and his quality of life is improved.”</p><p>Dr. Puricelli also credits American Family Children’s Hospital for investing in a new piece of equipment – known as a Coblator – that uses plasma-technology to carefully remove just enough tissue to cure Bryson’s sleep apnea.</p><p>After one night in the hospital, Bryson went home with relatively little pain – something that can be a short-term side effect from this surgery.  </p><p>“Before the surgery, he was having sleep interruptions about 8 times an hour,” says his mother, Jill. “Sometimes, if he stayed awake, he would make sounds that woke the other kids, who would yell, ‘Bryson’s making noise!’”</p><h3><b>Huge improvement in Bryson’s sleep quality</b></h3><p>Since the surgery, Bryson, a freshman at Stoughton (Wis.) High School, is having less than 2 sleep interruptions an hour (1 is considered normal). Instead of being the first one up in the house each morning, he sleeps in like a typical teenager. His parents couldn’t be more grateful. </p><p>“We are very pleased,” says Jill, a mother of nine children – ages 9 to 26 – and grandmother of four. “We really wanted a permanent solution for Bryson -- not just something that would treat the condition, like a CPAP machine that would require constant cleaning and maintenance. Even better, Bryson will now have a greater sense of independence, which is something we wanted him to achieve. We will keep a close watch on him, as things can change in adulthood, but for the relatively small risk that comes with any surgery, this experience gave our son and our family a very large return.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>When Lauren Nettenstrom talks about her thyroid cancer treatment, nearly 13 years after she was first diagnosed, she analyzes it with the mind of scientist.</p><p>She explains how only thyroid cells uptake iodine, and she can say the exact imaging and treatment dose, in milliCuries, of radioactive iodine she received. She wants to understand how the replacement thyroid hormones she needs to take daily are working – and to understand when her body is signaling that the dose is off.</p><p>“I can go into the hormone signaling pathways and why it works,” Nettenstrom said, only half joking.</p><p>While she approached her cancer diagnosis and treatment with the same logic and understanding, naturally she also responded to the emotional and physical aspects of having cancer – both the first time, and then again at the time of her recurrence six years later. For example, though her medication dose is correct now, it took nearly a year for her and her doctors to find the right levels.</p><p>&quot;They start you on a dose, then you have to wait six to eight weeks for that to stabilize in your system, then you get a blood test and adjust from there. My dose was way too low, but they don’t want to start you out too high and there’s no way to predict because everyone&#39;s different,” Nettenstrom said. “Everything was just slow, like my hands weren’t doing what my brain wanted them to, I was sleeping 16 hours a day, and waiting to have the dose adjusted.&quot;</p><p>A graduate student in UW’s <a href=\"https://cancerbiology.wisc.edu/\">Cancer Biology</a> program at the time, Nettenstrom left the program and earned a Masters degree, not the doctorate for which she planned. She says she initially felt bad, but now she thinks, “I got a Masters and survived cancer!&quot;</p><p>Her time in the lab propelled her to a full-time research position in the pediatric immunology lab of <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L228</span> member <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7467</span>, MD. Over the next nearly nine years, Nettenstrom became an expert in flow cytometry, a lab technique in which cells are fluorescently tagged based on what proteins they contain and then analyzed.</p><p>&quot;We can take a bunch of cells in liquid, one cell at a time, and put them through a flow cytometry machine: the flow part is fluidics, and cytometry is the analysis of a cell,&quot; Nettenstrom said. “And we can evaluate single cells based on what markers are expressed on the surface or what is inside of them.&quot;</p><p>Today, Nettenstrom is a research specialist in UW Carbone&#39;s <a href=\"https://cancer.wisc.edu/research/resources/flow/\">Flow Cytometry core</a>, a central facility that houses equipment that Cancer Center member labs can use for their research.</p><p>&quot;We see so many things come through our lab, from the early development of ideas all the way through clinical trials,&quot; Nettenstrom said. “I’m no longer the expert on any one research project, but to see all of these ideas and to partner with Cancer Center researchers and local industry researchers, and getting to help them figure out how to answer their research questions – that’s one of the best parts of working here.&quot;</p><p>For example, Nettenstrom recently worked with Rupa Pike, PhD, the director of cell manufacturing at UW’s <a href=\"https://pact.wisc.edu/\">Program for Advanced Cell Therapies</a>, to prepare for a <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/news/forming-a-pact-to-treat-cancer-patients-with-cutting-edge-cell-therapies/51820\">clinical trial looking to reduce complications</a> from bone marrow transplants. Pike must use flow cytometry as a quality control measure to determine if the cells the clinicians are giving back to patients meet the trial’s criteria.</p><p>Despite having been part of UW Carbone for the better part of 14 years now – from her graduate studies to her current role – Nettenstrom does not really spend much time thinking of her own cancer diagnosis anymore.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m doing well now, and I&#39;m busy thinking about other things. Will there be more challenges? Of course,” Nettenstrom said. &quot;But I get to help these researchers do their best science, and I get to help in such a positive way. It is such a privilege.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>Kristin Meurrens estimates she has undergone more than 100 computed tomography (CT) scans. </p><p>The 38-year-old&#39;s medical problems began when she was 16 and was enduring painful periods and ovarian cysts. The issues continued as she experienced three ectopic pregnancies. She was misdiagnosed with interstitial cystitis (IC) - a painful bladder condition for which there is no cure. She underwent several procedures in hopes of relief from her IC pain, including cystoscopies and Botox injections into her bladder wall, but nothing helped. Eventually, she grew so discouraged that she confined herself to her room and was unable to take care of her family. &quot;The doctors at one hospital told me I had exceeded their capabilities, and they could no longer care for me,&quot; she says. &quot;I just sort of gave up.&quot;\r\n\r\nThen, a young emergency room doctor at a local hospital theorized that Kristin might be suffering from loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS), a rare disorder that results in debilitating flank pain and blood in the urine. She began researching it online and came upon a Facebook group that mentioned Hans Sollinger, MD, transplant surgeon at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. Transplant surgeons at UW Health, were performing a groundbreaking kidney autotransplant that had miraculously cured others with LPHS. Kristin, who lives in Prince Frederick, Maryland, traveled to Wisconsin for a medical evaluation.\r\n\r\nAt UW Health, Kristin underwent a lidocaine test, which Dr. Sollinger had developed three years prior. During the test, a urologist injected a pain relief medication into her ureter. Over the next day, she was free from pain, which confirmed for doctors at UW Health that her pain was originating in her ureter and she had been suffering from LPHS. &quot;That was by far one of the best days of my life,&quot; she says. &quot;For the first time in many, many years, I felt no pain and I finally had answers. Suddenly, my hope had been restored.&quot;\r\n\r\nKristin also learned something very important that doctors had overlooked during the past two decades: Her left renal vein was compressed between her aorta and vertebral column, a condition known as posterior nutcracker syndrome. The compression was linked to all of Kristin&#39;s health problems, including the LPHS which had made it difficult for her to do just about anything.\r\n\r\nA month after the lidocaine test, transplant surgeons performed a kidney autotransplant on Kristin. They removed her left kidney and placed it in her right pelvic area. &quot;It&#39;s all like a jigsaw puzzle,&quot; says Kristin. &quot;When you have compression of your left renal vein, it will affect your body from the bottom up. In my case, the blood started to pool and engorge all the veins in my pelvic area, including my ureter vein.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe procedure worked, and Kristin&#39;s pain was gone. For her, it was miraculous because she had spent so many years seeking help for her debilitating pain. &quot;Doctors labeled me a drug-seeker,&quot; she says. &quot;Every time I had a flare-up, they sent me to a CT scan. That was their way of determining whether I was going to receive pain medication that day.&quot;\r\n\r\nThey prescribed countless medications for Kristin&#39;s supposed interstitial cystitis, including drugs that made her hair fall out and turned the whites of her eyes yellow. As she became sicker and sicker, one doctor offered to remove her bladder in the hopes that that would take away her pain. She elected not to take this extreme step - and now she&#39;s glad she did.\r\n\r\n&quot;The kidney autotransplant changed everything for me - my blood pressure, the rhythm of my heart,&quot; she says. &quot;It gave me my life back. It gave my family their mom, wife, daughter and sister back. I work full time now, and I have not taken any pain medications in more than a year. The UW Health surgeons restored hope in me again.&quot;\r\n\r\n </p>",

The woman from Knoxville, Tenn., was in excruciating pain every day and when she saw local doctors, they accused her of seeking pain medications. &quot;I felt helpless,&quot; she says. &quot;All people wanted to do was give me pain medications or shrug their shoulders at me.&quot;</p><p>Peyton&#39;s health problems began when she passed her first kidney stone at age 10. She started passing kidney stones twice a year until she was 15, when she was passing them monthly.</p><p>By age 16, she began experiencing similar pain once every week, but her doctor told her she wasn&#39;t passing stones at all - she was just in pain for seemingly no reason, while also vomiting and shaking uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nHer junior year in high school, she was diagnosed with renal nutcracker syndrome, a condition that occurs when the left renal vein becomes compressed. She underwent surgery three times to try to move and decompress her vein, but it didn&#39;t work. In the end, she lost her left kidney. Even with only one kidney remaining, Peyton continued to have severe disabling pain.\r\n\r</p><p>Peyton&#39;s mother was desperately seeking answers on the Internet when she came across Hans Sollinger, MD, transplant surgeon at UW Health in Madison. She learned Dr. Sollinger had helped other girls who experienced similar pain, and she decided to contact him. That connection was what gave Peyton her life back.\r\n\r\nDr. Sollinger asked Peyton to come to Madison and undergo a lidocaine test. This test, which Dr. Sollinger developed, became a game changer for her. A urologist injected a pain relief medication into her ureter. Over the next day, she was free from pain, which confirmed that her pain was originating in her ureter. Dr. Sollinger diagnosed Peyton with loin pain hematuria syndrome, a rare disorder that causes recurring loin pain and blood in the urine.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 2, 2016, transplant surgeons at UW Health, performed a kidney autotransplant, removing her right kidney and almost all her ureter, and replacing her kidney in a different location. This procedure was complicated by the fact that she had only one kidney, and this kidney had two arteries. Any technical mishaps and Peyton would have been on dialysis. Fortunately, everything went well.\r\n\r\nNow 21, Peyton is a surgical tech student at the Tennessee College of Applied Technology, and she hopes to become a physician&#39;s assistant someday. In addition to being a full-time student, she works in the surgery department at a local hospital and exercises every day. &quot;I never thought I would be able to do so much,&quot; she says. &quot;The transplant surgeons are my heroes.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>When the University of Oregon Class of 2018 celebrated its commencement, there was one graduate who was particularly grateful to be marking this accomplishment.</p><p>Karen Seifert, who started college in 2011, had suffered through a small bowel repair, two other major surgeries, and a period during which she was nearly homebound. Because of her medical issues and her need to take time off, it took Karen seven years - but after a kidney autotransplant at University Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, she was finally healthy enough to finish school and start her professional life.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Karen was diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery syndrome, a disorder in which a portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery due to lack of a fat plate. Because of that, she experienced severe weight loss and needed a feeding tube for a short amount of time to try to obtain the nutrition she needed. Her doctors hoped the feeding tube would help the fat plate grow back, but it didn&#39;t, so they performed a surgery during which they rebuilt her fat plate and rerouted her small intestine. That helped for a while, but she continued to experience problems and saw doctor after doctor, hoping for an answer.\r\n\r\nAfter multiple diagnoses - including a small bowel blockage and median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS), a condition in which the median arcuate ligament presses too tightly on the celiac artery and for which Karen had another surgery - she was diagnosed with nutcracker syndrome, yet another vascular compression disorder that can lead to loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS). LPHS causes loin pain on one or both sides of the body and blood in the urine. For Karen, it resulted in more than just pain - she also had extreme nausea, difficulty urinating, fatigue and weakness. She had to withdraw from school and move home to Newport, Ore., with her parents because she was too weak to go to class. &quot;It was debilitating to the point where I struggled to make it off the couch to go to the grocery store,&quot; says Karen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no one in Oregon had any good options for treating Karen. Then, her mother learned about the LPHS Clinic at UW Health through a Facebook group. She also found that transplant surgeons at UW Health performed kidney autotransplants which had resulted in miraculous recoveries for other patients. Karen and her mother visited UW Health in August 2017, and three months later, Karen had the autotransplant. The transplant surgeons removed Karen&#39;s kidney and transplanted it into a new location.\r\n\r\nKaren&#39;s recovery was difficult, but her pain faded, and she slowly regained some of the energy she had lost. She was able to return to school for the spring 2018 semester, and she graduated just a few months later. Karen found a job as an e-learning teacher at a high school in her hometown, and she hopes to earn her master&#39;s degree in school counseling.\r\n\r</p><p>&quot;My health is better than I could have imagined it being right now,&quot; she says. &quot;I believe God brought me to UW Health, which ended up being a true blessing.&quot;</p>",

As her pediatrician conducted follow-up examinations, he noticed her direct bilirubin level was high. Ila was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology team at <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L169</span> where further testing showed that Ila had biliary atresia, a liver disease in infants where the bile ducts in the liver become increasingly damaged and block the flow of bile from the liver to the intestine.</p><p> Ila had a surgical procedure that will, in some cases, fix this blockage, but Ila’s liver disease continued to worsen. As her liver began to fail, Ila was referred to the UW Health Pediatric Liver Transplant Program under the care of <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P11326</span>, MD, pediatric hepatologist and the medical director of the UW Health Pediatric Liver Transplant Program.

      "story": "<p>Kellie Pribbernow was growing increasingly concerned about her 5-year-old son Christian’s chronic tummy aches and other digestive problems.</p><p>Thankfully, she had an excellent medical resource available right in her hometown of Oshkosh, Wisconsin – the Aurora Children’s Health Clinic – which is also an outreach clinic for Madison-based UW Health pediatric specialists. It wasn’t long before Kellie received a diagnosis of her son’s condition from Dr. Dan O’Connell, a UW Health pediatric gastroenterologist who sees patients from the Fox Valley at the Oshkosh clinic twice a month. Christian, as it turns out, is one of the very few – 1 in 100,000 people – with a genetic gastrointestinal disease called Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS). </p><p>JPS is a chronic condition caused by a genetic mutation in which polyps or growths develop in the colon. The symptoms of JPS, such as bloody stools, pain, constipation or diarrhea for more than a week, are present with many other conditions, but sophisticated testing available at UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison allowed physicians to pinpoint the problem.</p><p>“There are a wide variety of what we call polyposis syndromes that are usually hereditary,” says Dr. O’Connell. “With more detail in our genetic testing, we get a better diagnosis. Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome is a rare syndrome that can run in families, but there can also be new mutations that are not present in any other family member, as in Christian’s case.”</p><p>“Juvenile” refers to the type of polyp, not the age of the person diagnosed, and while the polyps themselves aren’t cancerous, those with JPS are at higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. If left untreated, polyps can grow quite large and cause painful bowel obstructions.</p><h3>Madison care team is like extended family</h3><p>Since that first appointment with Dr. O’Connell in late 2018, Christian and Kellie have made multiple trips to Madison for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at American Family Children’s Hospital. </p><p>Though scoping procedures and colonoscopies to monitor and remove polyps are routine for patients with JPS, Christian had some unexpected complications that required extended hospital stays, including surgeries to resect his colon and remove his gallbladder.</p><p>Dr. O’Connell and other pediatric gastroenterology team members have become part of Christian’s extended family. </p><p>“Despite some pretty traumatic experiences,” Kellie says, “Christian still loves the hospital. When I told him we needed to go back to Madison for another surgery, he jumped up and down and shouted, ‘Yay!’”</p><p>Child Life therapists played a big role in making the hospital experience less scary – and even fun – for Christian. When Christian feared getting his first IV poke, the Child Life specialist explained the process and brought him a bear with an IV so he could have a friend with him.  Adding to his collection of Legos, friendly nurses, pancakes for dinner, “Minions” movie viewings, and one-on-one time with mom also make the hospital stays special. </p><h3>Doctor’s ability to make children feel comfortable is key</h3><p>Christian will deal with chronic illness his entire life, but the long-term relationship with his care team, especially Dr. O’Connell, makes all the difference to his well-being. </p><p>“Christian is always excited when he sees Dr. O’Connell, because he has always gone above and beyond to help Christian feel comfortable, well-informed and cared for,” says Kellie. “Even when Christian was just five, he always made a point to begin each visit talking directly to Christian and asking, ‘What do you think about this?’ and ‘Do you have any questions?’”</p><p>Dr. O’Connell enjoys the challenge of working with patients of all ages and stages of development.</p><p>“Asking questions directly of the child with parents in the room is important, especially with younger kids who can add insight into what the parents see,” says Dr. O’Connell. “How each patient perceives and interprets how their body feels at every age is really important to my decision-making, and parents are sometimes surprised by what they hear from their child. It’s a partnership with parents to work toward the best outcome for their child.” </p><p>It’s a partnership Kellie deeply appreciates. “Dr. O’Connell wants to know how I’m feeling, too,” she says. “It’s hard when you’re a parent, since you don’t have the training or experience. I’ve taken it upon myself to learn anatomy starting with the GI system so I understand what’s going on.” </p><p>When the preparation for procedures led to difficult side effects for Christian, such as low blood sugar, dehydration and severe nausea, Dr. O’Connell worked with Kellie to make the clinic appointments and procedures as “Christian-friendly” as possible.</p><h3>UW Health team knows that kids don’t like surprises</h3><p>Understanding what’s happening at each visit has also helped Christian.</p><p>“He really likes to know what&#39;s going on and what they are going to do next,” Kellie says. “The nurses are all really good in telling Christian,  ‘This is the tape,’ or ‘This is going to be wet,’ and ‘This won&#39;t hurt,’ or ‘This will have a pinch’, and that really helps a lot.” Christian also loves to show his favorite souvenir from the hospital – a pill camera that traveled throughout his digestive system.</p><p>Dr. O’Connell reflected, “You can see the resilience Christian has built as he’s had a difficult diagnosis and how Kellie has built her knowledge and been a great advocate and partner in his care.”</p><p>Looking ahead, the focus will always be on making Christian’s quality of life as normal as possible.</p><p>“JPS is a life-long condition, but we were able to catch it early,” says Dr. O’Connell. “We’ll continue to monitor Christian and keep a close eye on things to prevent any complications,” It’s really about quality of life. Our goal is to make sure he has as normal digestive function as possible to limit the impact on his day-to-day life. We’ve been able to preserve that and are addressing nutritional issues.”</p><p>Dr. O’Connell is one of many UW Health physicians who travel throughout Wisconsin and Illinois to provide regional care.</p><p>“Regional outreach helps us serve kids around the state which is especially important for patients with rare conditions who need care from experts. The physical distance of our hospital can be a barrier for families,” he says. “We come together with other healthcare systems to provide specialized children’s care because smaller communities typically lack local access to pediatric specialists more commonly found in larger cities. Our doctors really enjoy the work. Seeing the gratitude from patients and families makes the care rewarding.”</p>",

Neurosurgeons in Michigan deemed Bentley’s tumor inoperable, due to its large size and location deep within the brain.</p><h3>&#39;We didn’t think we were going to have him for very long&#39;</h3><p>“He was only 6, and we didn’t think we were going to have him for very long,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;It was devastating.&quot;</p><p>Casey Madura, MD, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Helen DeVos Children&#39;s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., told the Thatchers that the likely outcome of performing brain surgery did not justify the risks, which included paralysis.</p><p>&quot;If Bentley had any chance of a meaningful surgical outcome,” Dr. Madura said, &quot;I told the family I would recommend they see someone with more experience.&quot;</p><p>Having trained as a neurosurgery resident at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 2008-15, Dr. Madura had just the team in mind for Bentley: The <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 7w77YiGuQbXis73h0vfcQn</span>.</p><p>Once the UW Health team learned of Bentley’s urgent situation, adult and pediatric neurosurgery clinicians quickly collaborated to plan the young boy’s surgery in Madison.</p><p><span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5472</span>, MD, a UW Health adult neurosurgeon with extensive experience in operating on deep tumors, worked closely with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10630</span>, MD, a pediatric neurosurgeon based at UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital.</p><blockquote><p>Bentley would not be here today without Dr. Baskaya, Dr. Stadler and the team at UW Health. You cannot put into words how grateful we are. They have given us extra time with our child that is just priceless.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;We embrace collaboration across the adult and pediatric teams if the patient can have a better outcome,&quot; Dr. Baskaya said. &quot;With expertise in microsurgery and deep-seated tumors on the adult side and age-appropriate experience on the pediatric side, we can offer the patient the best of both worlds.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Very few centers collaborate this way,&quot; Dr. Stadler said, &quot;and we both felt Bentley would emerge better off because of it.”</p><h3>Bentley comes to Madison; UW Health team removes tumor</h3><p>Drs. Baskaya and Stadler reviewed Bentley’s MRI. Working as the captains of a large surgical team spanning University Hospital and American Family Children’s Hospital, the neurosurgeons were confident they could safely remove Bentley’s tumor with minimal risk of paralysis, giving him more time and the best chance for life-prolonging care after surgery.</p><p>“Not too many medical centers – including children&#39;s hospitals – would have operated on Bentley,&quot; Dr. Stadler said. &quot;With Dr. Baskaya’s expertise in highly complex tumors and mine in pediatric neurosurgery, we had the team and medical infrastructure to give Bentley and his family the ray of hope they had been searching for.&quot;</p><p>On Oct. 29, 2018, the Thatchers woke up knowing that their son would undergo a day-long brain surgery.</p><p>&quot;We were on edge, but Dr. Baskaya and Dr. Stadler helped prepare us,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;They were calm and confident, and told us their goal was to remove 100 percent of the tumor.&quot;</p><p>By the time surgery ended that day, the surgeons had removed 85 percent of Bentley’s tumor. There were no signs of paralysis, but Bentley was not happy when he was told that a second surgery would be needed to remove the remaining 15 percent.</p><p>&quot;Bentley kind of panicked at first, but Dr. Baskaya explained it so well to him,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;He said they just needed to unzip the zipper-like incision on Bentley’s head and get the rest of the tumor out.&quot;</p><p>Three days after that second surgery, Bentley and his parents went home to Michigan – just in time for a very special day.</p><p>“He was supposed to be hospitalized a few more days,&quot; Ashley said, &quot;but Dr. Baskaya insisted that Bentley should be home for his birthday the next day. I thought that was just incredible.&quot;</p><h3>Bentley enrolls in clinical trial after cancer recurs</h3><p>Unfortunately, as is often the case with this grade of tumor, Bentley’s cancer came back in February 2019.</p><p>That same month, the Thatchers took their son to C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial of a new drug called ONC201 – an oral treatment that is believed to uniquely bind itself to a dopamine receptor (DRD2) and slow the ability of the tumor to survive and spread.</p><p>Carl Koschmann, MD, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at the University of Michigan, says that although Phase I of the trial focuses only on patient safety, there are signs that patients such as Bentley are experiencing tumor shrinkage.</p><p>“Bentley has been stable since going on the study,&quot; said Dr. Koschmann, who graduated from the <a href=\"https://www.med.wisc.edu/\">University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health</a>. &quot;For now, the study seems to indicate that the drug is safe. Our hope is that it also will be proven effective so children like Bentley can live even longer than they would without the drug.&quot;</p><p>Now 7, Bentley is doing OK, but wishes he could enjoy more normal children’s activities. He is often sore and tired. It’s not ideal, but his parents cherish every day they have with their son.</p><p>&quot;Bentley would not be here today without Dr. Baskaya, Dr. Stadler and the team at UW Health,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;You cannot put into words how grateful we are. They have given us extra time with our child that is just priceless.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>When preschool teacher Beth Battista learned that Lyla Carreyn, a 5-year-old student at the same school, needed a kidney transplant, she said &quot;I just knew I had to get tested.&quot;</p><p>Beth&#39;s donation story went viral on social media after Lyla&#39;s mother, Dena Carreyn, shared a Facebook post about Lyla&#39;s need for a living kidney donor. Lyla was diagnosed a year ago with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), a rare autoimmune disorder, which meant Lyla needed to endure dialysis 12 hours each day. Beth saw the post, telephoned the UW Health Transplant Program, and her donor evaluation was initiated.\r\n\r\nIn October, Beth and Dena were invited to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where Beth received a thank you video and gift package from Aaron Rodgers, her favorite Green Bay Packers player. (Watch video) They also shared with Ellen the need for more living donors. Beth, who is a registered organ, tissue and eye donor and also on the bone marrow registry, is focused on the good news that living donation creates.\r\n\r\n&quot;People like this very positive story,&quot; says Beth. &quot;There&#39;s so much negativity in media right now that I think that&#39;s why our story went so viral so quickly.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo quickly, in fact, that Beth had to swiftly talk with her children, ages 6 and 8, about her plan to donate a kidney, before they heard about it from anyone else.\r\n\r\n&quot;They asked, &#39;Why you, mom?&#39; &quot; But, says Beth, &quot;After I explained how sick Lyla was, and they met her and saw all of the machines and medications, they understood.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeth has been fielding questions about living donation, and &quot;talks about it a lot,&quot; she says. &quot;My friends didn&#39;t know much about organ donation, so this has been a great way to educate more people.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I always knew I was meant to be a wife and a mom and a teacher,&quot; says Beth. &quot;This was just another calling. I wanted to give Lyla the future. A normal, happy, healthy future and I want anyone who has this same feeling to go in and get tested as a donor and give the gift of life.&quot;\r\n\r\nBeth&#39;s parents set the example she&#39;s tried to follow, of always being generous and giving back. In the 1990s, Beth&#39;s uncle and godfather received a kidney, and Beth remembers how that changed his life. &quot;Someone gave him 10 extra years, and I just wanted to give back,&quot; says Beth. &quot;It was my turn.&quot;\n\r</p><h3>If you would donate a kidney for someone, would you donate for anyone?</h3><p>Stories like Beth and Lyla&#39;s draw a lot of media attention. Across the nation, patients, desperate parents, family and friends frequently use social media as a method to alert others to their situation, and those messages often result in dozens of offers to donate. One of those generous people may save the life of their intended recipient, but most will not consider the idea of donating to someone else on the waitlist.\r\n\r\nWhile the thought that you might be the person to save a desperately ill child is enticing, new programs make it possible for just about anyone, regardless of blood type, to be a living donor to someone in need. At UW Health, potential living kidney donors can consider many donation options. Some, like an internal paired kidney exchange, take UW Health donors and their intended recipients and &#39;swap,&#39; the donors and recipients to find the best matches for each recipient. Other programs, such as the National Kidney Registry, and a similar program managed through the United Network for Organ Sharing, do the same but with donors and recipients from across the nation. Often, these exchanges are initiated by a humanitarian or non-directed donor, someone who wishes to donate to anyone in need.\r\n\r\nAlmost 100,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a kidney, and wait times can be lengthy, resulting in dialysis and other serious complications associated with kidney failure. Recipients of organs from a living donor have better outcomes for a longer period of time than those who wait for a deceased donor. Living donors not only save the life of their recipient, but reduce the number of people on the deceased donor waiting list.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Kym Pfister carried her son, Gus, for 35 weeks before he was born. Now, the 2-year-old carries a piece of his mom inside him—her kidney, which she donated to him when he was 15 months old. She says now she wishes she had another kidney to give, now that she can see just how much of a difference it has made for him.</p><p>\rKym and her husband, Jonathan, learned at her 20-week ultrasound that something wasn’t right—doctors thought his bladder might have ruptured because there was fluid from his bladder in his abdomen. At 27 weeks’ gestation, Kym lost all her amniotic fluid, and at 32 weeks, doctors confirmed Gus had no kidney function. “I was cautiously optimistic,” Kym says now. “I tried to remain positive that maybe the doctors were wrong, and we were going to live happily ever after.”\r\n\r\nWhen Gus was born in October 2018, doctors at his hospital immediately hooked him up to a ventilator so he could breathe, but at first, he was too sick even to be transferred to American Family Children’s Hospital for expert care. Then, at 4 days old, he was well enough to move hospitals, and at 20 days old, he started dialysis 24 hours a day to remove the toxins from his blood. “The first two or three weeks were terrible,” says Kym. “I cried all the time.”\r\n\r\nGus stayed at American Family Children’s Hospital for three months, then joined his three big brothers at home. He responded well to dialysis, and the Pfister family developed a routine for giving him the 12 hours of dialysis he needed every day. But they knew that was only a temporary measure. Gus needed a kidney transplant at American Family Children’s Hospital, and Kym was a match. So, they waited until he was old enough to be able to handle such a big surgery.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted their grand plan for a transplant in the spring of 2020. During the first couple of months of the worldwide pandemic, the UW Health Transplant Program was forced to delay every non-emergency surgery. “We were devastated,” Kym says. “On the other hand, he did so well on dialysis that we weren’t worried he wasn’t going to make it to transplant.”\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 2020, Kym and Gus both were wheeled into surgery. When they came out, both had one healthy kidney in their abdomen—and Kym was a living donor hero.\r\n\r\nThese days, she describes him as the “happiest, most laid-back kid ever.” Gus has made tremendous strides since his transplant, and his parents are hopeful that having a healthy kidney will give him a bright future.\r\n\r\n“If I could give every single person a piece of me right now, I would,” Kym says. “Everyone should get a good chance at a quality life.”\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Many women experience morning sickness at some point during their pregnancy, but for some, their illness is much more severe. </p><p>This was the case for Cecelia, a mother of eight, who suffers from hyperemesis gravidarum, a rare condition during pregnancy that is characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, weight loss and electrolyte imbalance.\r\n\r\r\r\nUnlike morning sickness, the symptoms are severe and do not subside. This puts the mother and her unborn child at risk for dehydration, malnutrition, low birth weight, preterm birth and even miscarriage.\r\n\r\r\r\nCecelia&#39;s condition persisted and worsened with each pregnancy. When she was pregnant with her son Ciaran, she needed more effective and aggressive treatment.\r\n\r\nShe sought the guidance and help of UW Health gastroenterologist Dr. Sumona Saha, who operates a clinic that specializes in caring for pregnant women with gastrointestinal problems. Cecelia thinks the level of care she received was second to none.\r\n\r\nAs an advocate for women who suffer from hyperemesis gravidarum, Cecelia explains, &quot;I speak to women across the country with this condition and many become so ill during pregnancy that they lose their jobs, are unable to function at home and are at risk for medical complications and miscarriage.&quot;\r\n\r\nCecelia is thankful that Dr. Saha&#39;s care was compassionate, comprehensive and collaborative. As a busy mom and fulltime UW law professor, she was grateful that &quot;Dr. Saha worked in collaboration with my obstetrician to make sure I could function at home and continue to teach despite my illness.&quot;\r\n\r\nHyperemesis gravidarum can lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Patients like Cecelia become so ill that they are deprived of necessary fluids and calories that both they and their growing babies need. During her pregnancy, Cecelia had to seek IV hydration, first at the emergency room, and then at home through a peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC line), which allowed for intravenous access for a longer period of time.\r\n\r</p><p>Later in her pregnancy, she also required IV nutritional support. She received care in the hospital, but with Dr. Saha&#39;s support was then able to manage both her hydration and nutritional needs at home through her PICC line.\r\n\r\nCecelia and her family are grateful for Ciaran&#39;s healthy birth. Her condition ended almost instantly after giving birth, which allowed her to resume normal drinking and eating.\r\n\r\n&quot;Dr. Saha&#39;s program is rare and unique. I wish more women had access to the standard of care I received,&quot; says Cecelia. &quot;It enabled my husband and me to have the family we always dreamed of.&quot; </p>",

      "story": "<p>One of the many wonders of the human body is the way a baby’s skull expands as the child’s brain and head keep growing.</p><p>Most of us never give it a thought, but a baby’s skull is far from fully formed at birth. Instead of a single piece of intact bone, the top of a baby’s skull consists of five bony plates separated by narrow gaps called sutures. For comparison, imagine the caulking that lies between the tiles of a bathroom floor. With a baby’s head, however, the sutures, along with the two circular “soft spots” on top of the head, allow the brain to grow quickly in infancy, then gradually harden into bone over the first several years of life.\r\n\r\n\rUnfortunately, for about one in 2,500 babies, the bony plates join together too soon – a condition known as craniosynostosis. Because the brain becomes “caged in” by an inflexible skull, these infants develop an abnormally shaped head. If not treated, these babies can be at risk for brain damage because of the gradually increasing pressure. Some can experience developmental delays or intellectual disabilities, because the condition can prevent the brain from growing and working normally, or because the baby has a genetic condition that led to the craniosynostosis and other brain-related issues.\r\n\r\nFortunately, most children treated for craniosynostosis go on to live healthy and happy lives, provided they are checked regularly for proper head and brain growth. One such child, Emilio Plascencia of Tomah, Wisconsin, came to American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison in early 2019 after his local physician suspected that his two “soft spots” had already closed. His diagnosis was confirmed by pediatric neurologist, John-Peter Temple of Gundersen Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin.\r\n\r</p><h3>Surgery needed to restore normal head shape</h3><p>\rEmilio and his parents – Braeven Olson and Leonel Plascencia-Bravo -- were quickly referred for further care to UW Health’s Pediatric Craniosynostosis Clinic at American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Temple told us the UW surgeons in Madison were very good,” says Braeven. “It was an anxious time because we knew they prefer to do surgery on these babies before they are six months old. The surgeons made us very comfortable by explaining everything so well and making sure our questions were answered.”\r\n\r\nInfants like Emilio receive a unique approach to care at American Family Children’s Hospital. Each family whose child is diagnosed with craniosynostosis meets with the full team from the very first visit, and they continue with their team of surgeons for evaluation, surgery, recovery, and development. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10630</span>, MD, a UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon and <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10322</span>, MD, UW Health pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeon, work closely together, and they were eager to work with Emilio and his family to come up with a long-term plan to keep him growing and doing well.\r\n\r</p><h3>Close collaboration yields better outcomes</h3><p>\r“This kind of surgery goes better when Dr. Garland and I meet each child and family as early as possible,” says Dr. Stadler. “This team-based approach lets us bring our unique skill sets to the operating room and come up with the best plan,” he adds. “In Emilio’s case, our recommendation was to do a surgery that would create new space for his brain to keep growing and then allow his head to assume a more normal shape.”\r\n\r\nIn March 2019, Dr. Stadler and Dr. Garland took Emilio to surgery, cutting the bone across the top of his head from ear to ear. During the three-hour operation, they inserted two metallic devices called distractors, which remained in place for about five months, helping Emilio’s bone and tissues slowly stretch and grow. A small part of the two distractors sticks out of the baby’s head, allowing his parents to turn the device in increments of less than a millimeter twice each day.\r\n\r\n“Parents are usually a little skittish about doing this at first,” says Dr. Garland, “but they typically become more comfortable after a few tries. Ultimately, many find it helpful knowing they are doing something tangible to help their child.”\r\n\r\nDr. Garland also makes it a point to acknowledge the fear every parent has when surgery is looming for their child.\r\n\r</p><h3>Building trust with families is key\r</h3><p>“I don’t believe there is such a thing as ‘minor’ surgery,” she says. “While we bring extensive training and experience to each procedure, we know that any parent is going to be anxious and it’s important to meet them where they are to build their trust.”\r\n\r\nEmilio’s mother, Braeven, was very confident once she checked out the two surgeons’ credentials.\r\n\r\n“I watched their videos and saw where they studied,” she says. “I was also very impressed by the nurses and nurse assistants who took such wonderful care of my baby.”\r\n\r\nFive months after Emilio’s first surgery, Dr. Stadler and Dr. Garland removed the distractors. His head has assumed a more normal shape, and he is expected to grow normally.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t imagine having taken Emilio anywhere else,” says Braeven about American Family Children’s Hospital. “They were just so amazing.”</p>",

      "image": "/content/images/.jpg",
      "story": "<p>To look at him at birth, Titus Nee appeared to be a healthy, strong baby, weighing nearly 8½ pounds. It would not be long, however, before Titus&#39; parents - Nicole and Eric - discovered that their newborn third child would be struggling for survival with every breath.</p><p>The first, but not most urgent, concern doctors noticed with Titus was a cleft palate, or a split in the back portion of the roof of his mouth. Surgery to repair this condition could wait for at least a year.\r\n\r\nMore troubling, however, was Titus&#39; inability to gain weight. He couldn&#39;t nurse because of the cleft palate, and virtually every drop of bottled milk he tried to drink would dribble out of his mouth.\r\n\r\nTitus&#39; breathing was also worrisome because it was quite noisy, especially at night. He also stopped breathing intermittently - for 3 to 5 seconds at a time, then catch his breath, gasp slightly and resume breathing.\r\n\r\nHis local pediatrician in Sun Prairie, Wis., referred Titus to American Family Children&#39;s Hospital in Madison, where UW Health pediatric otolaryngologists - ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons - expressed serious concerns about Titus&#39; weight and breathing issues.\r\n\r\n&quot;Being told that your baby is ‘failing to thrive&#39; was pretty scary,&quot; says Nicole.\r\n\r\nNicole and Eric learned that what little milk Titus was getting into his mouth was going not into his stomach, but his lungs - a dangerous condition called aspiration. Immediately, Titus was hooked up to a feeding tube because of the risk of further aspiration. He soon began to gain weight, a ray of sunshine amid so many clouds of concern.\r\n\r</p><h3>Jaw deformity pinpointed as culprit</h3><p>\rAdditional testing revealed that Titus was laboring to take in each breath. Very little air was getting into his lungs because his tongue would fall back further than it should, blocking most of his airway. Ultimately, Titus&#39;s troubles were attributed to a jaw deformity. He was born with a small lower jaw that was set back just enough to prevent normal rhythmic breathing. He also was diagnosed with Pierre Robin Sequence, which comprises three conditions:\r\n\r</p><ul><li><p>A smaller than normal, recessed lower jaw\r</p></li><li><p>A tongue that falls too far back\r</p></li><li><p>Airway obstruction, making breathing difficult\r</p></li></ul><p>It wasn&#39;t long before UW Health pediatric craniofacial surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10322</span>, MD, sat down with Nicole and Eric to discuss a remedy - a rather jarring sounding procedure called jaw distraction surgery.\r\n\r\n&quot;For babies like Titus, this surgery lengthens the jaw, freeing up more upper airway space so he can eat, breathe and sleep normally,&quot; explains Dr. Garland. &quot;We do this by carefully separating the jaw and inserting what we call a distraction device. It has two small rods attached to either side of the jawbone. The other end of the rods, which slightly protrude from the side of the face, have a screw on the end. Twice a day for about two weeks, a doctor or nurse gently turns each screw, further separating the bone, millimeter by millimeter. During the hours between the screw adjustments, the jawbone naturally grows to fill in the gap and the jaw slightly lengthens. Once the jaw is extended far enough - usually a few months later - the baby comes back and we remove the distraction rods.&quot;\r\n\r\nTo Nicole and Eric&#39;s ears, this all made sense. They had all the confidence in the world in Dr. Garland and her team. Still, the idea of putting their baby through such a big surgery was overwhelming, as it would be for any parent. \r\n\r</p><h3>Pager was Mom and Dad&#39;s lifeline during surgery\r\n\r\r</h3><p>Titus was not quite 2 months old on Feb. 25, 2019, the day Nicole and Eric kissed their baby boy goodbye just before he was taken to the operating room. For the next few hours, their lifeline would be an electronic pager that periodically flashed short updates such as:\r\n\r\n&quot;Surgery is progressing. Titus is continuing to do well.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Dr. Garland is finishing up. Please head back to the operating floor.&quot;\r\n\r\nLate that afternoon, Dr. Garland met with Nicole and Eric, assuring them that Titus did great.\r\n\r\n&quot;Everything went according to plan and Titus&#39; vitals stayed strong throughout surgery,&quot; says Nicole. &quot;Tears of joy and relief came to our eyes knowing that things went so well.&quot;\r\n\r\nBaby Titus made it through but recovering from such a massive surgery would have its share of bumps along the way. For the next seven days, he was in a medically induced coma, tethered to a ventilator and countless tubes and wires.\r\n\r\nBy Day Five in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), Dr. Garland asked Nicole if she wanted to try turning the screws on Titus&#39; jaw distraction rods herself.\r\n\r\n&quot;Seriously?&quot; Nicole said.\r\n\r\nNot hesitating for long, Nicole gave it a try.\r\n\r\n&quot;It was surreal,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I felt the clicking, which was kind of eerie, but it made me feel like I actually did something to help open my son&#39;s airway.&quot;\r\n\r</p><h3>Family adjusts to &#39;studio apartment&#39;</h3><p>\rAfter a week in the PICU, Titus was moved to a regular hospital room on the P4 Unit - a place that Nicole and Eric would begin calling their family&#39;s new &quot;studio apartment.&quot; With two other children - ages 8 and 5 at the time - life was chaotic, but the Nee family made it work, thanks to lots of support from family and friends.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thankfully, we only live 30 minutes away, so we managed. I slept at home a couple of nights when Titus was in the PICU, but once he moved to P4, I spent every night in his room while Eric headed home each day to care for our two other kids,&quot; Nicole says. &quot;It wasn&#39;t easy, but Eric and I would keep reminding ourselves, &#39;It&#39;s treatable, it&#39;s curable and we have a plan.&#39; &quot;\r\n\r\nAfter more than seven weeks in the hospital, Titus finally got to go home, where he would continue to heal.\r\n\r\nIn July 2019, Titus&#39;s jaw had grown to the point where Dr. Garland could take him back to the operating room and remove the metal rods from his jawbone.\r\n\r\nSix months later, in early 2020, Dr. Garland performed the cleft palate repair surgery to close the gap in the roof of his mouth. Like all children born with a cleft palate, Titus will return for follow up care, perhaps until high school.\r\n\r\n&quot;We will keep a close eye on him, especially to ensure proper speech and language development,&quot; says Dr. Garland.\r\n\r</p><h3>Can&#39;t say enough about their baby&#39;s care</h3><p>\rReflecting on all the stress of the past 14 months, Nicole and Eric could not be more grateful for the care their son received.\r\n\r\n&quot;From the doctors to the nurses to PT, OT, and even Dan who runs the hospital café store, everyone was so wonderful to us,&quot; Nicole said. &quot;I&#39;ll never forgot one day Dr. Garland brought me a cup of coffee and some chocolates and just sat with me for two hours. It didn&#39;t even feel like doctor and patient, but more like two friends.&quot;\r\n\r\nNicole and Eric also appreciate how much they as parents were included in the daily rounds when the doctors and nurses involved in Titus&#39; care would discuss the plan for the day.\r\n\r\n&quot;You always want to advocate for your child, but you don&#39;t want to have the big ‘X&#39; on your chart as the crazy lady,&quot; Nicole says with a laugh. &quot;Really, though, I am so thankful not only for the amazing care, but the great relationships that made so many people at the hospital feel like family.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>It is hard for those of us without epilepsy to imagine what it’s like to have the neurological disorder. Most medical experts can only empathize with their patients.</p><p>But 23-year-old Bailey Royston understands both the clinical and personal sides of epilepsy. The UW Health electroencephalogram (EEG) technician, who works at both University Hospital and American Family Children’s Hospital, was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was eight years old.\r\n\r\n\r“My teacher noticed that I was blanking out and staring into space (absence seizures). That’s when our primary care physician referred us to UW Health neurologist Dr. Raj Sheth,” said Royston.\r\n\r\n\rLittle did Royston know that more than just the epilepsy would change her life.\r\n\r\n\r“The medical technicians and EEG equipment fascinated me at a very young age,” said Royston. “From that time, an EEG technician was all I ever wanted to be. I love it.”\r\n\r\n\rRoyston shares her story occasionally when the time is right. The time was right recently for Kolton Witte, a teenager who was frustrated that his epilepsy prevented him from driving. He also worried he would never get a job. His mother, Ashley Witte, shared the story with the children’s hospital Facebook page and described the conversation with Royston as good experience for her son.</p><p>Witte wrote “My son has intractable epilepsy and has been hospitalized a few times at AFCH. He gets frustrated when thinking about his future. He may never get a driver’s license. He thinks his life will be ruined and questions how he will get a job and get to work. I’ve been wanting him to meet someone with epilepsy that lives a normal life. We finally did during one of his hospital stays. The EEG tech was talking with us and she told us she has epilepsy. It was so nice for my son to hear her story and see she has a normal life and job even though she doesn’t have a driver’s license.”\r\n\r\r\n“He went from being frustrated to smiling. I’m happy that sharing my story can help someone else. I share it especially with both young people and adults, so they don’t feel alone,” said Royston. Her seizures are controlled by a surgically-implanted vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). The VNS sends electrical impulses up the vagus nerve to the brain. She is still on medication, but her goal is to wean herself off as much of it as possible.</p><p>“I had one big seizure in 2015 since the VNS was implanted in 2012 but nothing since then,” Royston explained. She is currently seeing neurologist Dr. Rama Maganti.\r\n\r\r\nRoyston and her life experience bring an important perspective to the neurodiagnostics team.\r\n\r\r\n“We are very fortunate to have Bailey on our team as she shares her knowledge and experience from the patient perspective with our patients and also reassures them and our team,” said Laura Michor, UW Health neurodiagnostics manager. “Not every EEG department is fortunate enough to have the personal expertise that Bailey brings to our team.”\r\n\r\r\nIn the meantime, Royston will continue sharing her story with patients.\r\n\r\r\n“It’s kind of strange to be on the other side of things. But I’m happy to help.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>For teenagers 16 or older, it is not that unusual to put off getting a driver’s license these days.\r Unlike most, however, Tom White’s reason for waiting is much more complicated.</p><p>Since he was 5, when he was hit by a car while bicycling, this young man from Cuba City, Wisconsin has been fighting his way back from a very serious trauma with few complaints. For the past 13 years, his journey has been filled with countless headaches, seizures, medical appointments and a challenging therapeutic diet intended to make his epilepsy more tolerable.\r\n\r\r\nNo, he has not started driving yet, but Tom White, now 18, has still traveled a very long way. His destination – which he believes is in sight – is a greater sense of normalcy than at any time since he can remember.\r\n\r\n The car accident, which came close to taking Tom’s life, left him with nearly daily recurring headaches from age 5 through 11½. Thankfully, physicians were able to relieve the pain with medication.\r\n\r\r\nShortly before turning 11, Tom had his first – and very convulsive – seizure, known as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. It lasted more than 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r“I came home one day, shocked to find an ambulance in the driveway,” says Tom’s mother, Lisa White. “Tom had started convulsing in the kitchen while eating supper with his older brother. It was very traumatic to say the least.”\r\n\r\r\nFor the next five years, Tom kept having seizures – about two a month, with most lasting about 20 to 40 seconds each. Most of his seizures looked like “staring spells,” although Tom also experienced occasional convulsive seizures as well.\r\n\r\n\rTom’s desire to drive began around the time he turned 15. Knowing that his seizures would need to be under control for Tom to begin driving, Lisa and her husband Todd began exploring other options.\r\n\r\n\r“Things were kind of in a rut at the time,” Lisa recalls. “Tom was on three medications, but still having breakthrough seizures. We could never leave him at home alone, because we never knew if he was going to have a seizure. We hoped there might be something out there to improve his quality of life, if not make him seizure-free.”\r\n\r\n\rBrain surgery was explored, but Tom was not considered a candidate at the time. Thankfully, however, UW Health had just hired <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9929</span>, MD, PhD, a neurologist with special training in ketogenic therapy, a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, diet that has helped reduce the frequency of seizures in epilepsy patients.\r\n\r\n\r“While we don’t know exactly how ketogenic diets work, they help put the body into ketosis, a state in which the body uses fat for energy rather than carbohydrates,” says Dr. Felton. “Studies show that about half of patients on a ketogenic diet have at least a 50-percent reduction in seizures.”\r\n\r\n\rIn the fall of 2016, Tom started a type of ketogenic diet called the modified Atkins diet (MAD). With only 15 grams of carbs to parcel out over the day, Tom loaded up on high-fat foods such as Italian sausage with parmesan cheese and cauliflower mashed potatoes, or sweets like peanut butter with chocolate drizzle.\r\n\r\n\r“With such a small carb allowance, this is not an easy diet, but Tom stuck with it for quite a while and had good results,” says Lisa. “Each week, he submitted a report to UW Health listing his daily food and water intake, weight and seizure activity. He ended up losing 50 pounds and he had more stamina.”\r\n\r\n\rThings were going well during the summer of 2017, however the seizures started again that Labor Day weekend.\r\n\r\n\r“Tom was experiencing more stress with his job at the grocery store and ultimately found it too hard to stick to the diet consistently,” says Lisa.\r\n\r\n\rThat fall, just before Tom turned 17, the Whites sat down with Dr. Felton hoping for something new.\r\n\r\r\n“We decided to reconsider surgery,” says Dr. Felton. “After more imaging and testing at American Family Children’s Hospital, we learned that while seizures were being triggered from both sides of the brain, Tom’s bigger seizures were coming from the right side. Smaller, more subtle seizures originated on the left side.”\r\n\r\n\rAt this point, Dr. Felton’s team and the Whites agreed on a two-part plan for Tom:\r\n\r</p><p>He would undergo surgery to remove part of the right temporal lobe in his brain to reduce, if not eliminate the big seizures; If left-brain triggered seizures still surfaced after surgery, Tom would be eligible for a new treatment called responsive neuro stimulation (RNS), which involves putting an implanted device in the skull that silently helps prevent abnormal electrical brain activity from turning into a seizure.</p><p>\rPart one of the plan -- the right temporal lobe surgery -- was performed on July 3, 2018, by UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10295</span>, MD.\r\n\r\n\r“The surgery went really well,” says Lisa. “Tom was awake the next day and rather talkative. He was able to come home five days after surgery and showed no visible signs of seizures for the next five months.”\r\n\r\n\rTom experienced some disappointment after having a 10-second seizure on December 8, 2018. He also had three non-visible seizures in late November that were picked up by home-based EEG monitoring of his brain’s electrical activity.\r\n\r\n\rBy mid-December, UW Health neurologists endorsed part two of Tom’s treatment plan, the responsive neuro stimulation (RNS), which will begin in March 2019.\r\n\r\n\rDriving for Tom remains on hold for now, but there is hope that RNS can play a part in building a seizure-free future for him.\r\n\r\n\r“So far, things are much better for Tom, especially since the surgery was done.” says Lisa. “He has much to look forward to, starting with high-school graduation in May 2019.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>18-year-old Kaden Colson of Lancaster, Wisconsin, began having seizures at age 5.</p><p>They were mostly facial twitches. Fast forward 9 years and the twitches have turned into grand mal seizures that he would suffer 2-3 times a day - and sometimes up to 10 times a day.\r\n\r\n&quot;It was a nightmare,&quot; said Kerin Colson, Kaden&#39;s mother. &quot;We came up with a system where he would knock on the wall to alert us that a seizure was coming.&quot;</p><p>He was on 7 seizure medications.\r\n\r</p><p>&quot;It became apparent that Kaden was having the type of seizures that doesn&#39;t respond well to medication,&quot; said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10295</span>, Kaden&#39;s neurosurgeon.\r\n\r\nDr. Ahmed said the time had come to do invasive monitoring for his seizures and to find the source in the brain that was causing them. Kaden underwent surgery to place a monitoring grid on his brain. That procedure revealed that the seizures were occurring from a part of the brain near normal speech function.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, after seizure mapping, surgeons can remove the part of the brain that triggers seizures.</p><p>&quot;In Kaden&#39;s case, we did an awake surgery to localize his speech function area in relation to the seizure focus, and to see if we could remove the seizure-causing focus safely,&quot; said Dr. Ahmed. &quot;As it turned out, the seizure-causing region was too close to the speech portion of the brain. We did not think it would be safe to remove it without causing severe problems with his otherwise normal speech function.&quot;\r\n\r\nWith surgery to remove that part of his brain off the table, Dr. Ahmed was tasked with finding something to at least slow the frequency and quiet the intensity of the seizures. Dr. Ahmed knew of a device, recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to control seizures that don&#39;t respond well to medications.\r\n\r</p><p>The problem was, the device was approved for patients 18 years and older. Kaden was 17.\r\n\r\n&quot;We were able to get an FDA exception in Kaden&#39;s case,&quot; said Dr. Ahmed.\r\n\r\nThe device is a neurotransmitter that operates very much like a heart pacemaker. The device is connected by leads to the part of the brain where seizures are activated and provides stimulation to control seizures. A remote monitor at home collects information from the neurotransmitter. The data are sent to a patient data-management system that neurologists can monitor to track seizure activity and treatment progress. Non-surgical adjustments can be made to the neurotransmitter for optimal treatment.\r\n\r\nMonths after the neurotransmitter was surgically placed in Kaden&#39;s brain, he has seen significant improvement.\r\n\r\n&quot;Seizure frequency and intensity have been reduced by more than 75 percent,&quot; said Ahmed.\r\n\r</p><p>Mrs. Colson said the surgery made a world of difference.\r\n\r\n&quot;It has not been anything like it used to be by any stretch of the imagination,&quot; said Colson.\r\n\r\nColson said her son&#39;s goal is to get off the remaining seizure medications. One has already been removed from his treatment plan.\r\n\r\n&quot;Kaden has a better outlook on life, and while it&#39;s not perfect, we&#39;ll continue to work toward his goals.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>When their baby wouldn&#39;t stop having seizures, a Madison family was losing hope. Once doctors discovered the problem, surgery stopped the seizures immediately.</p><p>For most families, the days, weeks and months after having a baby are filled with lots of joy – and some stress, typically due to lack of sleep, lots of crying, or running out of diapers at the wrong time.</p><p>\r\r\rOne Madison family, however, can only wish that the first several months with their baby were so blissful.</p><p>\rFor Agnes Glebocka and her husband Julio Leon of Madison, life with their newborn, Milena, felt like an endless nightmare as they watched their baby girl suffer from multiple seizures that started just days after her birth.\r\n\r\n&quot;Milena was having these seizures several times a day, every day,&quot; says Agnes. &quot;It felt like this had to be somebody else&#39;s life. Our doctors were trying, but the medications didn’t help, and things just kept getting worse.&quot;\r\n\r\nSeveral months went by, and life for Agnes and Julio was filled with much stress and little hope.\r\n\r</p><h3>Preparing for the worst\r</h3><p>&quot;They were preparing us for the worst outcome,&quot; Agnes says. &quot;They told us Milena would not develop well and that she would be seriously affected for the rest of her life.&quot;</p><p>UW Health pediatric neurologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6360</span>, MD, PhD, says Milena&#39;s case involved a difficult decision.\r\n\r\n&quot;We typically do not see a baby having seizures so soon after birth,&quot; he says. &quot;Milena&#39;s initial MRI scans suggested that she had something called polymicrogyria, a condition in which the brain develops abnormally before birth. The brain surface develops abnormally small folds, which can predispose the brain to make seizures. That&#39;s bad enough, but we also know that if there is one area of polymicrogyria, there may be others, and some areas might be so small that we can’t see them on MRI.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen she was one month old, Milena&#39;s case was discussed before the entire group of UW Health pediatric neurologists. There was concern that taking Milena to surgery at such a young age would involve too great of a bleeding risk, and that there might be other areas of polymicrogyria that would be left behind. Accordingly, surgery was put on hold.\r\n\r\nAside from her seizures, Milena continued to develop quite normally. Between her seizures, she was a delight to her parents. However, at 7 months of age, she began to use her right hand to reach for objects and bat at them – something also known as a right-hand preference.\r\n\r\n&quot;This was a concern,&quot; says Dr. Hsu, &quot;because babies should not develop a hand preference before one year of age. Milena&#39;s right-hand preference concerned us because the part of the brain that controls the left hand is the same side that contained the polymicrogyria.&quot;\r\n\r\nIt was time to act. Milena&#39;s care was transferred to Dr. Hsu and members of the epilepsy surgery team, including epileptologists <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10504</span>, MD, and <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10610</span>, MD, and pediatric neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10295</span>, MD, PhD. This team recommended removing only the part of the brain with polymicrogyria, while preserving the rest of the brain as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after surgery, however, Milena developed very frequent blinking spells, which an EEG test confirmed were actually seizures.\r\n\r\n&quot;Her seizures were worse,&quot; Agnes said. &quot;We were in despair.&quot;\r\n\r\nDr. Hsu conferred with his colleagues and then recommended removing all of Milena&#39;s right temporal lobe.\r\n\r\n&quot;This may seem drastic,&quot; he said, &quot;but a baby does not really use the temporal lobe for cognitive function at such a young age, and if it is removed early, the brain may &#39;rewire&#39; so that normal temporal lobe function is shifted elsewhere. If the temporal lobe is to be removed, the earlier it is done, the better.&quot;</p><h3>\rSecond surgery stopped the seizures\r\n\r</h3><p>The second surgery took place one week after the first, and the results were immediate. Milena&#39;s seizures stopped immediately.\r\n\r\n&quot;We cried tears of joy,&quot; says Agnes. &quot;Milena was now a happy, energetic baby. We could not believe such a miracle.&quot;\r\n\r\nAt 11 months of age, Milena is almost walking and developing like a normal child. She no longer has a right-hand preference and uses her left hand as much as her right.\r\n\r\n&quot;It is so amazing,&quot; says Agnes. &quot;After months of seeing her suffer and two brain surgeries, she has bounced back so well. We are so grateful for the care that gave us our daughter back.&quot;\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, neuropathological examination of the resected temporal lobe showed that what appeared on MRI to be polymicrogyria was instead focal cortical dysplasia, a condition defined by abnormal formation of the brain layers during brain development.\r\n\r\n&quot;There are supposed to be six layers of neurons at the surface of the brain,&quot; says Dr. Hsu. &quot;In Milena&#39;s area of focal cortical dysplasia, these layers were all mixed up.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn addition, examination of another part of the temporal lobe called the hippocampus showed scarring, probably caused by the frequent seizures.\r\n\r\n&quot;This scarring was visible only under a microscope, not on MRI,&quot; says Dr. Hsu. &quot;It was a good thing that we took out the hippocampus because had we left it in, it would probably have developed seizures on its own later.&quot;\r\n\r\nDr. Ahmed notes that it is critical to evaluate babies with seizures, even in infancy, to determine if they are surgical candidates for resection of the seizure-causing focus.\r\n\r\n&quot;Although this involves invasive surgery,&quot; he says, &quot;children who are candidates, have excellent seizure control following surgery and recover very well, even if we have to operate on eloquent or critical brain regions to gain seizure control.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Being free of seizures allows children to develop to their full potential that is otherwise not possible.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>Piper Droessler is the first Wisconsin baby to be positively screened for SMA through newborn screening and the first to be treated with a promising new drug, Zolgensma®.</p><p>Piper Droessler will not know it for years to come, but there is reason to believe this 3-month old baby may be spared the devastating effects of an incredibly debilitating disease she was born with.\r\n\r\nBorn in November 2019, Piper appeared to be perfectly healthy - just like her two siblings, Ellianna, 6, and Finley, 3. When Piper was one week old, the Droessler&#39;s phone rang with shocking news from the family&#39;s local physician in Platteville, Wis.\r\n\r\n&quot;Dr. (Anna) Svircev told us that our brand-new baby girl had a rare, potentially fatal disease called spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA,&quot; says Caiti Droessler, Piper&#39;s mom. &quot;Of course, we had never heard of it, but we were scared to learn that SMA can destroy most of your muscular strength.&quot;\r\n\r\nThat same evening, Caiti and her husband, Ben, spoke with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10944</span>, MD, a UW Health pediatric neurologist from American Family Children&#39;s Hospital in Madison. The Droesslers drove to Madison the next day to meet with Dr. Kwon, learning more than they ever expected to about SMA, a disease that affects at least 12,000 people in the U.S. - about half of them children.\r\n\r\n&quot;There was bad news and good news,&quot; Caiti says. &quot;The bad news was that an SMA diagnosis is something no new parent ever wants to hear. SMA causes muscles to become very weak, and can make walking, eating and breathing very difficult. Historically, children with SMA did not survive past 2 years of age. The good news, Dr. Kwon told us, was that just months before Piper was born, a new drug had been approved that could save Piper from serious damage to her muscles.&quot;</p><h3>\r\rZolgensma® shows great promise</h3><p>\rThe new drug, Zolgensma®, is a type of gene therapy, given once through intravenous infusion. It prevents further motor neuron and muscle degeneration by replacing the defective or missing gene (SMN1) that, when absent, causes SMA. By using a new gene that tells motor neuron cells to produce more survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, muscle degeneration can be prevented if given to the baby early enough.\r\n\r\nZolgensma®, which can be given to most children before 2 years of age, can&#39;t reverse damage that has already occurred to a child&#39;s motor nerve cells and muscles, but if given within the first three weeks of life, the chances of living a normal life are promising.\r\n\r\nThe obvious question is how did the Droessler&#39;s doctor know that Piper had SMA in the first place? She exhibited no signs of illness or distress. The answer lies in Piper&#39;s special place in Wisconsin medical history.</p><h3>\r\rNewborn screening of SMA can be a godsend</h3><p>\r\r&quot;Newborns with SMA like Piper look totally healthy,&quot; explains Dr. Kwon. &quot;Fortunately, her diagnosis was picked up on her newborn screening.&quot;\r\n\r\nEven more remarkable, says Dr. Kwon, Wisconsin had only begun including SMA on newborn screenings just six weeks before Piper was born. (Every newborn in the state is screened at 24 hours of life for 47 different conditions through a sample of blood collected from a heel prick.)\r\n\r\nOnce Piper&#39;s diagnosis was confirmed, things moved very quickly to set her up for the Zolgensma® infusion.\r\n\r\n&quot;It was all kind of a whirlwind,&quot; says Caiti. &quot;It&#39;s a very expensive treatment, so insurance had to approve it.&quot; At 3 weeks old, Piper received her Zolgensma® infusion. Since then, she has had eight blood draws and clinical assessments, and everything looks good so far.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#39;s so hard to believe Piper really has SMA because you would never know anything was wrong with her,&quot; said Caiti. &quot;She&#39;s a very happy baby and a good eater.&quot;\r\n\r\nMary Schroth, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Cure SMA - the leading national organization representing individuals and families impacted by SMA - says Zolgensma® is just one of a few new SMA treatments, including Spinraza®, that either have been or are soon expected to be, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\r\n\r\n&quot;This is a very exciting time for SMA patients and their families, because there were no treatments available until the first one, Spinraza®, was approved in 2016,&quot; says Schroth, a former UW Health pediatric pulmonologist. &quot;Another treatment, Risdiplam®, is expected to be approved later this year.\r\n\r\nWhile none of these therapies are totally curative, they are making a big difference in the quality of life for patients. In concert with more babies being tested for SMA at birth, we are making great strides and expect this progress to continue.&quot;\r\n\r\nPiper - who was featured in a Madison newspaper story as the first Wisconsin child to be diagnosed with SMA through newborn screening tests and receive Zolgensma® - soon became the talk of the town in Platteville.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#39;s kind of strange because so many people saw the story,&quot; Caiti says. &quot;We&#39;ve also used social media to connect with many other SMA families around the country. Hopefully our situation will increase awareness around the country so more states will include SMA on their newborn screening process.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>My last normal father&#39;s day was in June 2000.</p><p>At that point I was 33 years old and my wife Sara and I had been blessed with three beautiful children. Our oldest son Everett was 5, our daughter Olivia was 3, and our newest arrival, Isabella, was only 2.\r\n \r\nThree years earlier Sara and I had moved into a large and run down old Victorian house in Stoughton, Wis., and were neck deep in some major remodeling projects. About that time we had gutted the upstairs and had setup family sleeping quarters in the downstairs living room while we worked on the house nights and weekends. All in all life was going great – we were young and invincible and ready for anything.\r\n\r\nLater that year however things started to go wrong for us.\r\n \r\nIn August my cousin and good friend was killed in an ATV accident. In January 2001, Sara&#39;s mother was hospitalized with an illness that became a life threatening staph infection which resulted in a slow and painful recovery throughout the spring.\r\n \r\nThe good news however was that Sara was expecting our fourth child. In March 2001, our youngest son Jake was born and it looked like maybe things were back on track.\r</p><h3>A doctor&#39;s intuition that saved his life\r</h3><p>I took off work for a week after Jake was born and as part of my to-do list went to see my dermatologist, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5504</span>, MD, about a mole on my back that Sara had been after me for some time to have checked. It was immediately obvious that he did not like the mole as he decided to remove it right there in the office.\r\n \r\nThe first lab report came back indicating that the mole was in fact a melanoma but that it did not extend beyond the first layer of skin. It had been caught in time and no follow up treatment would be required.\r\n \r\nDr. Berg was not comfortable with the results, however, and using an intuition that likely saved my life, insisted on a second lab review. The second review indicated that the melanoma was in fact significantly deeper. With that second lab report my life for the next year was high jacked by cancer.</p><h3>The cancer journey begins</h3><p>\rI had a sentinel node surgery which indicated that the melanoma had in fact spread to my lymph nodes. The next step was a much more invasive surgery to remove all of the lymph nodes near the area where the mole was removed.\r\n \r\nAfter the surgery was completed I was fortunate enough to be referred to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5373</span>, MD, with the UW Carbone Cancer Center. Dr. Albertini started me on a four-week program of intravenous high-dose Interferon.\r\n \r\nInterferon is considered an immune therapy and is intended to mobilize the immune system to destroy any remaining melanoma &#39;seeds&#39; which might be lurking elsewhere in the body. A first I thought this sounded like a good deal as I would be avoiding traditional chemotherapy treatments. I soon learned however that the side effects were just about as bad, the only consolation being that they came without the hair loss.</p><h3>Getting through the toughest times\r\n\r</h3><p>So, by Father&#39;s Day 2001, I was in the midst of my high dose treatments and my family and I were going through a very difficult time. It was quite an education in how life can change in a very short period of time.\r\n \r\nI remember looking in on the kids at night and wondering how I ever ended up in a situation where these people were so dependent on me and I might not be able to be there for them.\r\n \r\nIn the end though, it was Sara and the kids who were there for me and got me through my toughest times. Jake was a perfect baby who smiled and slept and grew to be quite popular with our nurses at the UW. Olivia was always there with a joke or a smile to cheer me up and Everett and Bella would get me going to play catch or walk to the park. They all kept me hoping and moving forward.\r \r</p><h3>A slow return to health\r\n\r</h3><p>I completed the high dose treatments later that June, and by January 2002, had completed the subsequent lower dose self injection treatments. Slowly I began to regain control of my life.\r\n \r\nOver time I went from my initial five trips to the UW Carbone Cancer Center per week down to monthly then down to three-month checkup visits. Finally in March 2006, I had my final five year checkup and Dr. Albertini shook my hand and gave me a clean bill of health.</p><h3>Making a difference for melanoma care</h3><p>\r\rWhile I have not been back as a patient since, I have continued to meet with Dr. Albertini.\r\n \r\nAs fate would have it, my mother Janis was serving as a board member for a charitable trust based out of Milwaukee at the time of my illness. Over the course of my treatments, she learned of Dr. Albertini&#39;s dual role as clinician and researcher. \r\n \r\nIn 2006, she suggested that we meet with Dr. Albertini to determine if a donation from the trust might help further his research towards a more effective treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. As a result of our meeting the Gretchen and Andrew Dawes Melanoma Research Fund was established and annual donations from the trust have since helped to fund personnel and and equipment costs for Dr. Albertini&#39;s lab.</p><h3>Countless reasons to be grateful</h3><p>\r\rThrough the Father&#39;s Days to come as I continue to enjoy watching my kids grow I will remain forever grateful for the expert care I received from the UW Carbone Cancer Center and for all the people who saw me through.</p>",

      "story": "<p>When Jane DeShaw was diagnosed with breast cancer, her mind was awhirl.</p><p>&quot;Your mind is muddled because everything happens so quickly, while you&#39;re still trying to wrap your head around having cancer,&quot; she says.\r \r\n\r\nWithin days of a suspicious mammogram in 2013, she was scheduled for a stereotactic breast biopsy, but at the last minute, that procedure was aborted in favor of a wire-guided breast biopsy. The pathology report from that biopsy showed a breast cancer.\r\n\r\nA week later, a sentinel lymph-node biopsy was performed, with all procedures handled by a local general surgeon, who had also treated her father for colon cancer.\r\n\r\n&quot;You see the surgeon, the oncologist, the radiation oncologist, you see so many people that you feel like you are getting a second opinion,&quot; she remembers. But experts say that it&#39;s best to go outside a local group for a second opinion, because physicians in the same practice likely share the same theories on treatment.\r\n\r\nDeShaw suffered a painful complication of her biopsies: axillary web syndrome, which results in raised cords from the site of the breast and lymph node biopsies. It eventually cleared with physical therapy. Because her sentinel lymph nodes were clear, she did not undergo chemotherapy, but did have 33 rounds of radiation therapy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a follow-up mammogram the next year showed another suspicious area in the same breast, and DeShaw was faced with yet another round of decision-making. This time, she got up her courage to tell her doctor she&#39;d like another opinion of her options.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#39;m the poster girl for not wanting to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings; here in the Midwest, we&#39;re brought up to be polite, sometimes too polite,&quot; she says. But to her relief, her doctor was not offended. &quot;He said, &#39;Jane, that&#39;s fine,&#39; &quot; she recalled, and when she mentioned going to Madison, he told her he&#39;d heard good things about the University of Wisconsin Breast Center.\r\n\r\nSo Jane and her husband Phil made the two-hour drive from their home in Dyersville, Iowa - home of the iconic &quot;Field of Dreams” baseball movie - to the UW Carbone Cancer Center in Madison.\r\n\r\nThere she met with surgical oncologist Dr. Heather Neuman and they talked through her various choices.\r\n\r\nNeuman says it&#39;s important for women to talk through all the steps and clarify what is most important to them. For some, it is conserving their breast tissue. For DeShaw, it was most important to her not to have to worry about cancer recurring.\r\n\r</p><p>&quot;I was tired from everything that had happened and knew that I didn&#39;t want to live my life under the threat or worry that it would come back,&quot; she says.\r\n\r\nShe opted for a double mastectomy with reconstruction. Dr. Ahmed Afifi, a reconstructive surgeon, and Neuman, operated together during the 9½-hour procedure. Afifi is experienced in reconstructing breast tissue that had been made more delicate by previous radiation, a fact that made DeShaw even more certain she had made the right choice in coming to UW.\r\n\r\n&quot;There are some surgeons who won&#39;t even touch radiated tissue for a reconstruction, so I wanted to go where they were experts in the procedure,&quot; says DeShaw.\r \r\n\r\nNeuman says she likes to involve the reconstructive surgeons at the first consultation, so patients can make decisions with their end goal in mind. Taking time to talk through each step is worth it, she says.\r\n\r\n&quot;A breast cancer diagnosis is not a medical emergency,&quot; Neuman says. &quot;Yes, it has urgency, but I tell my patients that there&#39;s time to make a good decision. It&#39;s a decision that you&#39;re going to live with for the next 30 or 40 years.”\r\n\r\nEven if the second opinion is the same as the first, Neuman believes there is a benefit to hearing it, especially since a breast cancer diagnosis carries with it so much stress and so much information.\r\n\r\n&quot;Sometimes just hearing information for a second time makes it clearer,&quot; Neuman says.\r\n\r\nAs for DeShaw, the results of the pathology report this time were negative, and she&#39;s very pleased with how her reconstruction turned out. She says her oncologist at home complimented how nice it looked and asked who did the surgery. She also went immediately to physical therapy and did not have the cord syndrome that followed her first biopsy surgeries.\r\n\r\n&quot;I feel I have excellent doctors at home, but if I could tell another woman what I learned, I would tell her not to be afraid to get a second opinion right away,&quot; she says. &quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt to get all the information possible and discuss and review options with another medical expert so when all is said and done, there are no regrets. I am fortunate that I am in excellent hands both at UW-Madison and at home.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>When they were just 19 years old, twins Lindsay Clark and Holly Muenchow already knew they wanted to make a difference in the world. </p><p>They were both students at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis., and noticed that organ and tissue donation was not on most students&#39; radar.</p><p>Lindsay was disappointed that a biology class she took didn&#39;t mention it, and there was no student organization that promoted the gift of life. So, the sisters petitioned the student government to create the organization <a href=\"https://livelovedonate.com/\">Live. Love. Donate.</a></p><p>Six years later, it is now a thriving 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has helped grow the organ donor registry in Wisconsin and raised thousands of dollars to support families of transplant recipients. &quot;For us, there&#39;s no limit to how many people we can touch with organ donation,&quot; Holly said.</p><p>Lindsay and Holly had good reason to want to promote organ donation - it saved their father&#39;s life. Steve Muenchow received his first kidney transplant in 1991, just two years after he married their mother, Amy.</p><p>She knew he suffered from kidney disease when she met him, and right after their honeymoon, he needed to go to the hospital. He went on peritoneal dialysis, which kept him alive, but his quality of life was very poor. &quot;It was just so hard, but he was always positive,&quot; Amy said.</p><p>After receiving the gift of life, Steve&#39;s health improved remarkably - enough so that doctors gave them the green light to start a family. The twins were born in 1994 and Steve stayed healthy until 2006, when his new kidney began failing. He went on hemodialysis in October 2006, and in January 2007, Amy donated one of her kidneys to him. The twins were in 8th grade then and remember every part of the experience - watching their father suffer and then seeing how much better he felt with his new kidney.</p><p>They carried that experience with them to college, which is why they worked so hard to create Live. Love. Donate. And when their father passed away in 2014 after a brief battle with lung cancer, they were even more motivated to continue what they had started.</p><p>In addition to spreading the word about organ and tissue donation, the organization now hosts an annual golf outing that raises money for Restoring Hope Transplant House and the Mike Armbrust Transplant Fund at UW Health. The Mike Armbrust Transplant Fund provides financial assistance to transplant patients and their families by helping defray the cost of accommodations, travel and other unexpected, but related, expenses.</p><p>&quot;We have seen firsthand how many lives our organization is touching,&quot; Lindsay said. &quot;When you see that impact, it allows you to keep going and help countless numbers of people.&quot;</p>",

In 1997, she began experiencing acid reflux, further irritating her vocal cords.\r\n \r\n&quot;I was thinking, &#39;I have to hang this up,&#39; &quot; Reuter-Foss said. &quot;But it&#39;s taboo to talk about these issues in the circles in which I run. The assumption is that you&#39;ve done this to yourself through bad technique. You can&#39;t walk up to a conductor and say, &#39;Something&#39;s wrong with my voice.&#39; &quot;\r\n \r\nFortunately for Reuter-Foss - and her legions of fans - she was able to discuss her problem with the doctors and voice specialists at UW Hospital and Clinics&#39; voice and voice disorder research program.</p><p>In a very real sense, a team led by Diane Bless, PhD, and Charles Ford, MD, then-chairman of the UW School of Medicine and Public Health&#39;s Division of Otolaryngology Head &amp; Neck Surgery, prevented one of Madison&#39;s most distinctive voices from falling silent forever.\r\n \r\nThey began with a complete evaluation.\r\n \r\n&quot;In situations like Kitt&#39;s, you need to address the underlying problems, the behavioral things the patient is doing that are causing the problems,&quot; said Ford, who retired in 2018.\r\n \r\nIn Reuter-Foss&#39;s case, that meant several things, including her diet (spicy foods, eaten late at night) and choice of exercise (running), both leading to acid reflux.\r\n \r\nBut the root of Reuter-Foss&#39;s problem proved to be a pseudocyst that damaged the tissues on her vocal cords. In her attempts to sing around the problem, she also had developed nodules on her vocal cords. In 1999, Ford removed the cyst surgically, allowing her vocal tissues to heal. Then a team of speech pathologists led by Bless began teaching Reuter-Foss new ways to care for her voice.\r\n \r\n&quot;They gave me clear-cut answers,&quot; Reuter-Foss said. &quot;I had complete trust in them, and it was fun to be able to talk vocal shop with a doctor.&quot;\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Having your head shaved is the last thing a kid in middle school would want. Now 17, Sadie looks back on how her challenging medical journey helped her grow as a human being.\r\nKristine Sutter will never forget the night when she suddenly woke to the jarring sound of her 11-year-old daughter Sadie having her first seizure.</p><p>\r&quot;Sadie and her sister were sleeping on the living room couch,&quot; recalls Kristine. &quot;Suddenly in the middle of the night, Sadie starts crying out, &#39;Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo.&#39; I ran to the living room. As she is yelling, she had one arm straight up and the other was stiff.&quot;</p><p>\r&quot;We had no idea what was going on, so we called 911, but by the time the paramedics arrived, Sadie had stopped seizing.&quot;\r</p><p>Sadie had a second seizure a few days later, and many more over the next several months. Medications were prescribed, but the seizures kept coming even as the dosages were increased. Sadie&#39;s spirit was breaking, and she began feeling helpless. \r</p><p>Brain scan after brain scan was performed until finally, an MRI would reveal the culprit. Sadie had a brain tumor that was causing epilepsy. At age 12, she would need an operation to remove the tumor. \r</p><p>Brain surgery was scary enough for Sadie but having her head shaved before the operation was perhaps just as traumatic for a kid in middle school.\r</p><p>&quot;I felt judgment and I let that rule my life,&quot; Sadie wrote in an essay about her experience. &quot;I refused to go to social events, continue my sports or even talk to people in school. My lack of hair and the possibilities of seizures instilled fear in me.&quot;\r</p><p>Fortunately, Sadie went nearly a year following her surgery without another seizure.\r\n&quot;Then disaster struck,&quot; she continued. &quot;As I lay on the ground, shaking once again, I remember my dad crying over me, as we all knew that surgery was necessary for the second time.&quot;\r</p><p>Another head shaving was in store, but this time, Sadie didn&#39;t worry so much about being judged.</p><p>\rHer UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6392</span>, even came in on Father&#39;s Day 2015 to perform the surgery at American Family Children&#39;s Hospital.\r</p><p>&quot;The surgery has two phases,&quot; says Dr. Iskandar. &quot;First, we put electrodes on Sadie&#39;s brain and monitor her in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit,&quot; says Dr. Iskandar. &quot;Once we see enough seizure activity, we proceed with the second phase, which involves removing the area that is causing the seizures.&quot;\r</p><p>Sadie&#39;s surgery, says Dr. Iskandar, was especially challenging because her tumor was embedded in the brain&#39;s motor area that controls arm, hand and face movement.\r\nTo ensure that this region would not be injured during surgery, Dr. Iskandar electrically stimulated Sadie&#39;s motor function region to identify where it was so that he could avoid it while removing the seizure zone.\r</p><p>Nearly 3 and a half years after the second surgery, Sadie remained seizure-free with normal motor function. She was off medication and knows that her chances of staying seizure-free increase over time.\r</p><p>Although still a young woman, she has matured in a way that speaks volumes, especially when it comes to not sweating the small stuff.\r</p><p>&quot;I would not have the confidence I do now without overcoming the hardships I went through,&quot; Sadie wrote. &quot;I have learned to love others for who they are, for everyone is fighting their own battles. Never judge anyone because you do not know what is going on behind closed doors. Although my experience was physically and mentally taxing, I would not be who I am today without them.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>",

      "story": "<p>Jennifer Yancey remembers the whirlwind that hit her family when her youngest child, Phoebe, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor last summer.</p><p>A few days before, the family, which includes husband Mark and sister Peyton, 13, had been enjoying their traditional family vacation of fishing in Northern Wisconsin.\r\n\r</p><p>But when they got home to Oregon, Phoebe’s headache turned severe, and she soon had symptoms that resembled a stroke. An ambulance ride to American Family Children’s Hospital, a CAT scan, and emergency surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain followed within hours. A few days later, she had more extensive surgery by Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6392</span> to remove a large tumor from the thalamus region of her brain. Then came the pathologist’s report: Phoebe’s tumor was a stage 3 anaplastic astrocytoma. In other words, cancer.\r\n\r\n\r“The diagnosis was a complete shock,’’ Jennifer Yancey said. “And then we had this tornado of information to deal with.”\r\n\r\nToday, Phoebe knows more about brain tumors than any 11-year-old should know. Following surgery, she had 33 treatments of radiation, with Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5570</span>, and then 72 rounds of oral chemotherapy supervised by Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7193</span>.\r\n\r\n\rShe finished up her maintenance chemo treatment in early March, and her scans look good.\r\n\r\n\rPhoebe’s dark hair is growing back into a cute pixie cut that emphasizes her huge gray eyes and dimple, and she’s looking forward to starting to work out with her soccer team again.\r\n\r\n“Soccer was my everything,’’ she says. “When I had to give it up, it was devastating.”\r\n\r\n\rBut for everything she lost during the nine months of treatment, Phoebe has also gained a wisdom that is years beyond her age.\r\n\r\n\r“I used to want to be one of the girls on the Disney Channel,’’ she says. “Now, I’m just happy to be me. I like my own family and the house I live in. And my sister is everything to me.”\r\n\r\n\rSister Peyton had her own struggles with watching her only sibling go through cancer treatment.\r\n\r\n\r“You have to rely on your family, because none of your friends understand what you’re going through,’’ Peyton says. “It’s understandable, but it made it lonely. I got tired of people telling me that everything was going to be all right.”\r\n\r\n\rJennifer says that seeing the girls grow closer was one bonus of the family’s bout with cancer. Mark says his daughter’s positive attitude made it easier on the family.\r\n\r\n\r“She’s not afraid of anything,’’ he says. “She has so much positive spirit that it’s hard to be depressed when she’s leading the way.”\r\n\r\n\rThe family kept up as many normal activities as possible, even returning to the North Woods during Phoebe’s treatment. Jennifer says the best advice came from another mother whose child was going through a serious health condition.\r\n\r\n\r“She told me to have faith in my child and take the lead from her,’’ Jennifer says. “Once we adopted that, everything was easier.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>As a filmmaker and television producer who has lived and travelled all over the world, Lynn Scheid has found himself in dangerous situations more than once or twice.</p><p>But it was on a fishing trip in Northern Wisconsin where he came face-to-face with the greatest threat to his life. </p><p>“I felt ill, just didn’t feel good at all,” he said. “I had no breath, I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t even pick up my socks to put them in the suitcase.” </p><p>Thinking he was having a heart attack, Scheid got himself to a hospital, where doctors discovered he had a collapsed lung. As part of the work-up to find out why he had a collapsed lung, they also discovered a potentially cancerous mass in the same lung, which was biopsied during a procedure called a bronchoscopy.  </p><p>It was during this stay in the pulmonary ICU when he received the news: stage III lung cancer, bordering on stage IV. While he knew cancer could be a possibility, it couldn’t quite prepare for him for the actual diagnosis. “You hear that and you try to take it in, but it’s a difficult thing to hear, and at the same time, it’s like you’re not hearing it at all,” Scheid said. </p><p>That diagnosis brought him to the UW Carbone Cancer Center, under the care of oncologist <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/ticiana-a-leal-md/8554\">Ticiana Leal, MD</a> and radiation oncologist <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/andrew-m-baschnagel-md/9649\">Andrew Baschnagel, MD</a>. While lung cancer has historically been difficult to treat, advances in lung cancer research have produced new therapeutic options in recent years. Because of that, Scheid was able to have much more optimistic conversations with Leal about his prognosis.</p><p>“She said you’re not at a place where we just need to talk about palliative care, you’re at a place where we can talk about a cure,” he said. </p><p>What came next was an intense seven-week treatment period of chemotherapy and radiation. This was followed up with twelve months of Durvalumab, an immunotherapy drug which helps the body fight off the remaining cancer cells. The FDA approved this treatment for stage III non-small cell lung cancer in 2018. </p><p>The weeks of radiation and chemotherapy were grueling. During this time, Scheid experienced extreme pain and fatigue, on top of psychological and emotional stress. “I was feeling like I was going to die, not because the doctors told me that, but because just how horrible I felt,” he said. “I didn’t really think I was going to survive, to be honest.”</p><p>But then, in early 2020, something remarkable happened: the pain and fatigue started to drift away. With the side effects of the chemotherapy and radiation wearing off and the immunotherapy really getting to work, his symptoms became less severe, and his outlook began to change dramatically.</p><p>In other words, the treatment did its job. </p><p>“I started to feel human again,” Scheid said. “And then I started to feel hopeful. And then I started to get stronger emotionally.”  </p><p>Within weeks, he was taking long walks and exploring Madison by bike – activities that would have been impossible for him only months before. And while he continued to receive treatment in the clinic, it was in the community where he found healing. </p><p>“The entire town is kind of like an environment for curing,” Scheid said. “Beautiful lakes, wonderful little bike trails, it’s like a giant relaxation center. Even as the pandemic was happening, it was possible to still get outside, get some fresh air, and feel rejuvenated to some degree.</p><p>Now, more than a year after barely being able to breathe, Scheid is cancer-free and feeling good. While he’s done with treatment, he’s sticking around Madison until the threat of COVID-19 passes, which is okay by him. After all, Scheid believes he’s alive today because he was in the right place at the right time, under the care of the right people.\n\n“You end up in the middle of the worst moment of your life in the place with the nicest people and the best medical care you could possibly get in the country,” he said. “I was very lucky to have this experience here.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>Madison Fire Department Lt. Terry Ritter isn’t a “glass half-full” kind of guy – he’s just happy to have a glass to fill with more days of life.</p><p>A few years ago, his diagnosis of metastatic melanoma was so grim that he sold his “toys” – a camper, bikes and more - “so my wife wouldn’t have to look at them when I was gone.”</p><p>But thanks to timely medical advice at the hockey rink, extensive surgery and a clinical trial through the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15041</span>, Ritter is back to biking and climbing and treasuring each day.</p><p>“My wife Danielle and I recognize we have a glass to fill and appreciate and celebrate daily as it overflows while we watch our children grow and succeed through experience,” he said.</p><p>In a way, Ritter is following the advice that he used to give parents as a youth hockey coach: Don’t yell at the kids when they fall; cheer when they get up off the ice.</p><p>Ritter’s cancer journey actually began at an ice rink.</p><p>It was 2011 and Ritter, then 48, had discovered a large, hard lump on his chest while lifting weights at the firehouse. You should get that checked out, said the hockey mom who helped manage the team. His mother, the late Carole Ritter, a nurse practitioner, agreed.</p><p>When the metastatic <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15048</span> diagnosis came back from the pathologists, a UW surgeon who reviewed his file told him he’d be hearing soon from <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6292</span>, a nurse practitioner with the UW surgical oncology program. It was the beginning of an amazing relationship.</p><blockquote><p>I choose to live with vitality and to live in the now. When I got the diagnosis, I was told not to take any time for granted and I don’t.</p></blockquote><p>“Mary Beth Henry did so much for me – she is the kind of person who makes things happen,’’ he said. She got him in for a PET scan in two days when another patient canceled, and soon he was meeting with cancer surgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7871</span>, MD to plan his surgery.</p><p>Ritter, a former police officer who was trained in interrogation, liked what he heard from Weber and what he saw in her body language.</p><p>“She really infuses her patient care with intelligence and dignity,&quot; Ritter said. After the two agreed on a surgical plan, it was on to meet with medical oncologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5373</span>, MD, to see what could else be done to keep the melanoma from returning. Ritter already knew his odds with surgery alone were slim.</p><p>But Albertini offered an alternative to standard care: Ritter could try a clinical trial of a substance studied in the lab of UW Carbone researcher Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7574</span>.</p><p>The drug, hu14.18-IL2, is a targeted antibody that delivers immune-activating interleukin-2 to the location of cancer cells. Sondel had shown that it had promise in treating a children’s cancer called <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 13527</span>, and Albertini was leading a clinical trial to see if hu14.18-IL2 combined with surgery worked against melanoma.</p><p>Ritter and his wife talked about it, and decided that with young children at home, he really needed to try everything possible.</p><p>“You really shouldn’t go online,&quot; he said. “If you Google &#39;metastatic melanoma in the lymph nodes,&#39; you see that there is no survivability.&quot;</p><p>It didn’t hurt that he was also very impressed with his first meeting with Albertini.</p><p>“I thought, &#39;This guy is really dialed-in. He’s evidence-based and progressive,&#39; &quot; Ritter recalled thinking. He took part in the clinical trial, and while he experienced side effects – including extremely low blood pressure – the antibody worked.</p><p>Ritter received an initial dose of hu14.18-IL2 before surgery. Weber then operated on him, removing two melanoma tumors and every trace of cancer she could find. Ritter then received two additional courses of the antibody.</p><p>Ritter recently passed the five-year mark of being cancer-free, but the monitoring continues. He says he lives his life after metastatic melanoma on a short horizon, taking nothing for granted past his next doctor’s exam.</p><p>Sometimes Dr. Weber will get an early-morning text from Ritter, who often bikes the 15 miles between his home and the fire station.</p><p>“He’ll pause halfway, and watch the sun come up and tell me how happy he is to be alive,’’ Weber says, calling Ritter’s survival against the odds “truly amazing.&quot;</p><p>At work, in his job as a paramedic, he might be helping deliver a baby or racing to a fire. At home, with wife Danielle and kids Alex, 14, and Anabel, 13, you might find him packing up his family for a week of snowboarding in the Rockies and desert biking in Moab, Utah.</p><p>“I choose to live with vitality and to live in the now,’’ he said. “When I got the diagnosis, I was told not to take any time for granted and I don’t.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>In January, the FDA approved a new neuroendocrine tumor (NET) therapy, a radioactive, tumor-specific drug. Two months and dozens of hours of staff time later, the first patient at the UW Carbone Cancer Center - and in Wisconsin - received the treatment.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s the most positive treatment we&#39;ve ever seen in neuroendocrine tumors, so we&#39;re pretty excited,&quot; said UW Carbone gastrointestinal oncologist Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6732</span>. &quot;Normally when a new drug is approved, we have the infrastructure in place and it&#39;s not a big deal to offer it to our patients. But in this case, because it&#39;s a radioactive drug, we had to build the infrastructure from the ground up.&quot;</p><p>NETs of the gastrointestinal tract arise from specialized cells known as neuroendocrine cells. They are considered rare, representing only around one-half of one percent of all newly diagnosed cancers. NETs are often slow-growing, though most patients eventually succumb to their disease. In clinical trials with the new drug, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera), 65 percent of patients&#39; tumors stopped growing after treatment, compared to only 11 percent who received a higher dose of a common NET therapy. Eighteen percent of patients&#39; tumors shrank.</p><p>Priscilla Baerbock, a patient of Dr. LoConte&#39;s from Lake Geneva, was hoping to receive the treatment last summer. Diagnosed with NET in 2006, Baerbock estimates she has received at least a dozen different treatments for her cancer. As with many NET patients, these treatments worked for her for years, but her cancer eventually progressed. Without any other treatment options available, she and LoConte sought out clinical trial options, including the trial that eventually led to the FDA approval.</p><p>&quot;I tried to get into the clinical trial in Iowa last year, but it was closed,&quot; Baerbock said.</p><p>True to her nature, she did not give up.</p><p>&quot;She&#39;s modest, but she&#39;s strong and she&#39;s a fighter,&quot; said Ben Baerbock, Priscilla&#39;s son. &quot;You have to be strong to go through this for 12 years. When treatments would stop working, she was always ready for the next one.&quot;</p><p>Her daughter, Jessica Newlun, added, &quot;That&#39;s true of the staff here, too. They have been so willing to stay at the forefront of technologies and treatments.&quot;</p><p>LoConte is not sure if the Baerbock family knows exactly how much went into making the treatment available at UW Carbone. The FDA approved the treatment on Jan. 29, 2018, and physicians and staff here started moving immediately.</p><p>&quot;When we thought the FDA was moving to approve the therapy, we started having conversations, but there&#39;s not too much prep work you can do until you get FDA approval,&quot; LoConte said. &quot;I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say 50 to 60 people were involved. NETs are a rare disease and they sometimes seem like they&#39;re forgotten, so it&#39;s nice to see so many people rallying around a really exciting treatment.&quot;</p><p>Clinicians and hospital staff from oncology to nuclear medicine to radiation safety to pharmacists all worked together to be able to offer the treatment at UW Carbone.</p><p>&quot;As soon as it became available in Madison, we knew we wanted to come here,&quot; Newlun said.</p><p>With the first of four rounds of treatment now done, Priscilla Baerbock is able to go home to Lake Geneva, where she can continue to be active in her church and spend time with her children and grandchildren. She has to wait three days after each treatment round, when the radiation from the drug has reduced to safer levels, before seeing her family.</p><p>Lutathera is manufactured by Advanced Accelerator Applications. Due to the high cost of the drug, prior authorization is necessary.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Jordan Dorf of Aurora, Colo., had been walking around with a fatty lump on the side of his face since he was in high school.</p><p>While typically harmless, these lumps – known as lipomas – can be surgically removed for cosmetic reasons, and Jordan finally decided to have his taken off in the spring of 2019.</p><p>Before performing the procedure, Jordan’s physician ordered a routine CT scan which, unexpectedly, revealed a more serious problem.</p><p>&quot;All of a sudden, I’m hearing that they see a suspected mass near my brain, and I need an MRI. It knocked the wind out of me,&quot; said Jordan, a process improvement consultant in the financial services industry.</p><p>For this 45-year-old father of two kids (ages 12 and 8) – who also is going through a divorce – life was about to be upended once more. The lump on his face would have to wait. It paled in significance to what he learned was a large, non-cancerous tumor growing on his pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain. Known as the body’s &quot;master gland,&quot; the pituitary regulates human growth, metabolism, stress response and many other essential functions</p><p>Jordan’s tumor probably had been growing for 4 or 5 years. Although he hadn’t told anyone, his peripheral vision had been steadily declining. Reading smaller type on his computer screen became more of a strain. Looking back, he now knows that his vision problems were caused by the tumor pushing on his optic nerve.</p><p>Jordan saw an ophthalmologist, who adjusted his eyeglass prescription, but nobody ever suggested the possibility of a pituitary tumor.</p><p>“I wish I would have known enough about pituitary tumors to raise my hand,” he said.</p><p>Once he knew his tumor had to be removed, Jordan preferred to find a good neurosurgeon close to home.</p><h3>Seeking an experienced surgical team</h3><p>&quot;Unfortunately, the neurosurgeon I saw in Denver did not inspire a lot of confidence,&quot; Jordan said. “Many pituitary tumors are small and most are non-cancerous, but when the surgeon saw how large mine was, he seemed unsure sure how to treat it.&quot;</p><p>After exploring other centers around the country, Jordan sought help from the one person he never hoped to need in a pinch: His friend Josh, otherwise known as UW Health neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6878</span>, MD, who practices in Madison, about 1,000 miles from Jordan&#39;s home in Colorado.</p><p>&quot;I’ve known Josh since we were friends in high school in the late 1980s,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;I didn’t ever want to need his help for a medical problem, but I wasn’t satisfied with the answers I was getting at home.”</p><p>Dr. Medow told Jordan that one of his UW Health neurosurgery colleagues – <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9219</span>, MD – has extensive experience with a comprehensive team that treats large pituitary tumors. The UW Health team performs about 100 cases a year on patients like Jordan.</p><p>“When Josh said he would go to Dr. Ahmed if he had my tumor, I trusted him implicitly,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;So, I spoke with Dr. Ahmed by phone and decided to come to Madison for further evaluation.&quot;</p><p>Within a week, Jordan was in Madison seeing several providers during his first visit to at University Hospital.</p><h3>Less-invasive skull base surgery offers several benefits</h3><p>Especially appealing to Jordan was UW Health’s expertise in a less-invasive <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/14283\">skull base surgery</a> technique in which the surgeons operate endoscopically through the nose rather than opening the skull.</p><p>In cases like this, Dr. Ahmed&#39;s skull base team typically includes a UW Health Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon, such as <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8098</span>, MD, or <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10945</span>, MD. Other UW Health specialists who saw Jordan – such as ophthalmologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9118</span>, MD, and endocrinologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7248</span>, MD – illustrate the comprehensive nature of care available at centers that offer multi-pronged expertise in every facet of pituitary tumor care.</p><p>When it came time for Jordan’s surgery, Dr. Koszewski began the procedure by temporarily moving aside nasal tissue, freeing up more space for Dr. Ahmed to reach and remove the tumor. Then, both surgeons collaborate closely to put everything back together, leaving the patient free of scars or skin incisions.  The endoscopic technique also avoids any direct impact to the brain and allows for a much faster patient recovery than open surgery.</p><p>Even with a mass as large as Jordan’s, Dr. Ahmed was able to remove close to 95 percent of the tumor operating solely through the nose.</p><p>“For maximum safety, we left a small piece of tumor because of its proximity to Jordan’s pituitary gland and hypothalamus,” Dr. Ahmed said. “We will keep a close eye on Jordan, but if necessary, we can remove the small remaining tumor with open surgery at a future date. Jordan also is getting excellent care from Dr. Rein, the UW Health endocrinologist, to manage some hormonal issues. Thankfully, his overall prognosis is excellent.&quot;</p><p>Within a few days, Jordan was up and moving, but the first 48 hours after surgery were challenging. Swelling, which is normal after surgery, triggered pain, but Jordan was extremely grateful for the unrelenting care he received from the nursing staff.</p><h3>&#39;My nurse was an angel&#39;</h3><p>“I will never forget these nurses who got me through the rough spots,” Jordan said. “Cheyenne (Heidenreich) was one nurse from the Neuro ICU whom I will never forget. She was an angel who helped get me through the first night when I was in more pain than I had ever experienced. I literally couldn&#39;t speak – I could only moan – and Cheyenne was so attentive that she always knew just what to do to make things better. People like Cheyenne truly care. And you know something? Everybody smiles here. They never get surly or defensive or uncooperative. They just give and give, and they listen and solve problems. It’s a cultural thing here, and it’s really incredible.”</p><p>Thinking back on his decision to travel 1,000 miles for surgery, Jordan has no regrets.</p><p>“You want to have complete confidence when someone is operating on your brain, and here they inspired nothing but confidence because they showed nothing but competence,&quot; he said. &quot;Dr. Ahmed and Dr. Koszewski channel God through their hands, and everybody else on the team was amazing.&quot;</p><p>For someone who spent very little time in hospitals, Jordan has nothing but high praise for his UW Health experience.</p><p>As he got to know other UW Health patients and families staying at a nearby hotel, Jordan noticed a remarkably consistent theme.</p><p>“Every patient or family member I met described their situation as a health problem that could not be adequately addressed at home,” Jordan said. “Then they came here for treatment or surgery that saved their life.&quot;</p><h3>Jordan’s advice: Ask, ask, ask</h3><p>Finally, Jordan advises anyone having major health symptoms to ask if something unsuspected might be causing the problem.</p><p>“In my case, I thought the problem had to be with my eyes, not a big tumor at the base of my brain,&quot; he said. &quot;My advice is always ask your doctor if something else might be going on. Fortunately, my tumor was discovered before it got any worse, and I could not be more grateful for the care I received at UW Health.&quot;</p><p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Although Jordan’s pituitary tumor was discovered after he experienced vision problems, there are other symptoms that may be signs of a pituitary tumor, such as sudden severe headaches, facial numbness or pain, unexplained fatigue, mood changes, unexplained weight gain, changes in menstrual cycles in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Don’t hesitate to ask your doctor about pituitary tumors if you experience any of these symptoms.</i></p>",

      "story": "<p>Claudia McCormick hopes to someday be the world&#39;s longest living pancreatic cancer survivor. </p><p>She&#39;s got the battle scars to prove it. Two rounds of abdominal surgery left her with an incision she proudly describes as &quot;a map of Route 66.”\r</p><p>The Beloit woman also wants to use her hard-won wisdom to inspire others faced with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\r</p><p>&quot;I want to help other people and let them know to get a second opinion,&quot; she says. &quot;I would be dead right now if I hadn&#39;t followed my instinct.”\r</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7871</span>, her surgeon at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L228</span>, says that McCormick&#39;s story inspires hope.\r</p><p>&quot;Claudia&#39;s story is one that all of us want to be able to tell more — she is an amazing woman with resilience and fortitude, who agreed to all of our recommended aggressive treatments for pancreas cancer, and because of this, she has beaten the odds,&quot; says Weber. &quot;She has an incredible multidisciplinary team of doctors helping her through this, but the victory is all hers.”\r</p><p>Both McCormick and Weber want to increase the odds of surviving pancreatic cancer, so they are supporting the Aug. 12 &quot;Roll and Stroll,” to support pancreatic-cancer research at UW Carbone Cancer Center. The event includes 50- and 10-kilometer bike rides, a two-mile walk, as well as music and family fun at Capital Brewery in Middleton.\r</p><p>McCormick&#39;s journey began in the fall of 2016, when she noticed some vague early symptoms. She felt tired; her skin was itchy and slightly yellow. Her doctor wasn&#39;t sure what was wrong; that&#39;s when McCormick&#39;s survival instinct kicked in the first time.\r</p><p>&quot;I asked her to check my liver enzymes and I didn&#39;t even know what liver enzymes were, she says. They came back high. A follow-up ultrasound and biopsy revealed a tumor about one and a half inches big in the head of her pancreas. The diagnosis was stage 1B adenoma carcinoma.\r</p><p>After three months of FOLFIRINOX, a combination of five chemotherapy drugs, in March 2017, a surgeon at a community hospital attempted to do a Whipple procedure to remove the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, bile duct, and parts of the stomach and small intestine.\r</p><p>But when the surgeon opened her up, he decided he couldn&#39;t safely operate.\r\nWhile McCormick was still unconscious, the surgeon gathered her family. McCormick heard the verdict herself, later.\r</p><p>&quot;He said there was nothing he or anyone could do and that I had months to live,&quot; she says. &quot;He basically wrote me off.”\r</p><p>McCormick, a mother of two grown sons and a grandmother of one, began putting her affairs in order. She got very depressed. But then she got mad.\r</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s not God, and not going to tell me when it&#39;s time to go,&quot; she says.\r</p><p>Family and friends rallied around her. Her partner, Al, who had lost a wife to colon cancer, became her &quot;best angel,&quot; cooking and caring for her. Her sisters and brother-in-law chipped in with support from afar, and lots of Internet research on her disease.\r</p><p>&quot;I wanted to show them that their support was really meaningful,&quot; she says. &quot;Knowing how much they were doing for me, I couldn&#39;t just give up and die.”\r</p><p>She asked her medical oncologist to look into clinical trials, and she began another round of oral chemotherapy along with external beam radiation.\r</p><p>Her younger sister found supplements that she believes helped her body heal, including high dose CBD oil, Frankincense oil, turkey tail mushroom and a Chinese remedy called &quot;bitter melon,” among others.\r</p><p>Finally, in late August 2017, she came to the UW Carbone Cancer Center, where Weber met with her to discuss her case. McCormick was impressed.\r</p><p>&quot;She has this aura about her that is really serene, and these beautiful long fingers,&quot; McCormick recalled. Weber was willing to attempt another Whipple procedure, although she told McCormick her odds of being able to complete the operation were only about 50-50.\r</p><p>So when McCormick woke up after surgery in November 2017, her first question was: &quot;Did it happen?”\r</p><p>&quot;When I heard yes, I started crying,&quot; McCormick remembers.\r</p><p>The biopsy showed that the tumor had shrunk and had been completely removed. Since then, two scans have shown her clear of cancer. Her CA 19-9 number, which measures antigens in the blood released by tumor cells, fell from 535 at diagnosis to 35 after treatment to 13, well in the normal range, at her last check-up.\r</p><p>&quot;Now I have a second chance at life, and I want to get out there and help other people,&quot; she says. &quot;I tell them: You have to fight. You also need a support system. I couldn&#39;t do it alone and no one else can, either.”\r</p><p>She recommends the information and support available at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (<a href=\"https://www.pancan.org/\">PanCAN</a>). Her brother-in-law found the site, and through it, she found Weber.\r</p><p>McCormick is getting involved in advocacy for more funding for pancreas cancer research and volunteers with UW&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/pancreatic-cancer/pancreas-cancer-task-force/38121\">Pancreas Cancer Task Force</a> – made up of patients, community leaders, family members, and caretakers dedicated to funding pancreas cancer research at UW&#39;s Carbone Cancer Center.\r</p><p>Years ago, during her corporate career, she was inspired by motivational speaker Tony Robbins, and wanted to use that passion to help others.\r</p><p>&quot;Since I have a second chance at life, I now have that chance to help others overcome the odds and beat this disease,&quot; she says. &quot;If I&#39;m not helping someone every day, then I&#39;m not doing enough. This, I feel absolute passionate about. I can&#39;t waste a day!”\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>In one sense, 11-year-old Braxsten Wiemiller of Evansville, Wis., is a typical fifth-grade boy.</p><p>A gifted athlete, Braxsten loves to swim, play baseball, basketball, soccer and even tap dance. He also loves hanging with his two 16-year-old twin sisters – Sadee, a competitive dancer, and Hanna, a gifted athlete who excels in soccer.</p><p>For much of the past seven years, however, a large part of Braxsten&#39;s world has been anything but routine. At age 3, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. At age 5, he had his first seizure – something that his parents at first thought was related to his diabetes.\r</p><p>After another seizure two months later, Braxsten&#39;s family took him to American Family Children&#39;s Hospital in Madison, where an EEG procedure to monitor Braxsten&#39;s brain activity suggested he had epilepsy, and that more seizures could follow even if his diabetes was well controlled. Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6360</span>, a UW Health pediatric neurologist, ordered a brain MRI – which was normal – and put Braxsten on an anti-seizure medication.</p><p>For the next two years, Braxsten did great on this medication. He did not have a single seizure and Dr. Hsu was considering weaning him off the medication when Braxsten inexplicably had another seizure at age 7. Two more seizures followed.</p><p>&quot;These weren&#39;t the kind of violent seizures you might think of,&quot; said his mother Crystal Sperry, a special education assistant at Evansville Middle School. &quot;He didn&#39;t shake or stare; he could see and hear, but his eyes would flutter for about 30 seconds. At one point, he was seizing 20 times a day.&quot;</p><p>Fortunately, repeat MRI imaging did not show a brain tumor. Still, despite being on as many as four medications at the same time, the seizures kept coming. After they kept increasing, Braxsten had to be hospitalized and became very distraught after having bad reactions to emergency anti-seizure drugs that typically work with most children.\r</p><h3>Clues suggested a different type of epilepsy\r</h3><p>With this unexpected turn of events, Dr. Hsu began to re-think his original diagnosis of generalized epilepsy, in which seizures are triggered throughout many places in the brain. Upon reflection, Dr. Hsu suspected that the seizures were focal in origin, meaning one specific area of the brain was responsible.\r</p><p>&quot;Although Braxsten&#39;s first EEG tests were consistent with generalized epilepsy, his behavior during the seizures was more indicative of focal epilepsy.&quot; Dr. Hsu said. &quot;The good news was that surgery can be considered to remove the seizure-causing area if it is focal.&quot;\r</p><p>Further imaging and evaluation suggested that Braxsten&#39;s problems began before he was born, when the layers of his brain were still forming.\r</p><p>&quot;During the mother&#39;s pregnancy, brain cells, or neurons, start to form deep in the brain and migrate to the outer layers of the brain,&quot; Dr. Hsu said. &quot;If these neurons don&#39;t make it all the way to the outer surface or fail to line up properly after reaching the surface, an epilepsy-causing condition known as focal cortical dysplasia can occur.&quot;\r</p><p>This condition, Dr. Hsu adds, is often hard to see on brain imaging. In Braxsten&#39;s case, it was not visible on brain scans done at ages 6 and 8 but was finally evident on his third brain scan at age 9.</p><p>&quot;There was just enough blurring in the right frontal lobe to signal a problem,&quot; Dr. Hsu said. &quot;Once we identified this area as focal cortical dysplasia, Braxsten&#39;s prognosis improved because we now had a target area that might be removable through surgery.&quot;\r</p><p>Although the prospect of curing Braxsten&#39;s epilepsy with surgery gave his family hope, it was essential that UW Health experts prove that there truly was a single section of brain that was not only responsible for the seizures but could also be safely removed surgically.</p><p>To confirm their hypothesis, doctors would need Braxsten to spend a week in the hospital so they could monitor his brain activity while hoping to provoke seizures that could be analyzed for their origin.\r</p><h3>Surgeon planted 14 electrodes in brain\r</h3><p>After extensive analysis, Braxsten&#39;s doctors became more convinced that his seizures were indeed focal. To be absolutely sure, however, they came up with a plan to conduct an invasive diagnostic procedure known as stereo-EEG.</p><p>&quot;We scheduled Braxsten to undergo a stereo-EEG to help determine the exact location and extent of the area causing the seizures and also confirm whether we could proceed with removing that area without interfering with other parts of the brain that control essential functions,&quot; said UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P10295</span>, MD. \r</p><p>With the help of image-guided robotic equipment known as ROSA, Dr. Ahmed carefully placed 14 needle-thin electrodes deep into Braxsten&#39;s brain. Braxsten then was closely monitored for five days, yielding a highly accurate &quot;blueprint&quot; showing exactly where his seizures originated and to what areas they had spread. Through a process called mapping, his doctors could also identify the brain areas that control speech and language – areas that had to be protected from surgical interference.</p><p>The stereo-EEG study gave Drs. Hsu and Ahmed and Braxsten&#39;s family the necessary information to move ahead by removing the seizure-causing area without damaging Braxsten&#39;s language or motor areas.</p><h3>Lesion removed; Braxsten has been seizure-free\r</h3><p>Braxsten underwent the surgery just before turning 10. Much to his family&#39;s relief, he did very well and has been seizure-free since the surgery.</p><p>&quot;We are optimistic that the seizures will not come back,&quot; Dr. Ahmed said. &quot;We were very pleased that Braxsten&#39;s seizure network was clear enough to remove surgically while still preserving his essential brain function.&quot;\r</p><p>Braxsten&#39;s family also took it as a good sign that the scar on his head resembled the letter &quot;C,&quot; extending from the right side of his forehead to behind his ear.\r</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re (Chicago) Cubs fans, so in a way, the &#39;C&#39; scar was kind of cool,&quot; Crystal said.\r</p><p>Braxsten&#39;s family is breathing much easier these days. He regularly goes to speech therapy and will continue to be monitored by the pediatric neurology and neurosurgery teams. After enduring countless seizures, drugs and hospital stays before the age of 10, Braxsten is feeling a lot more like a normal kid.\r</p><p>&quot;His friends were so wonderful,&quot; Crystal said. &quot;While he was seizing, I asked his sports coaches if I could speak to his teammates so they knew how to help if Braxsten had a seizure during a game or practice. I think that reduced their discomfort and allowed them to be more supportive.&quot;\r</p><p>With her husband, David Wiemiller, by her side, Crystal soldiered on through five challenging years before Braxsten&#39;s epilepsy was put in the rearview mirror.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t become that emotional until a year after it was over,&quot; Crystal said. &quot;That&#39;s when it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I trusted my precious child&#39;s life to these incredible physicians – Dr. Hsu and Dr. Ahmed – and all the nurses and staff, and that trust was repaid so many times over. American Family Children&#39;s Hospital is just the perfect place to be. I could not imagine going anyplace else.&quot;\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>What can a single family do, when faced with the loss of a 28-year-old son to brain cancer?</p><p>If you’re the Wolfe family of Menomonee Falls, the answer is: A million things.</p><p>This June 23 will mark the 20th year that Jerry and Nancy Wolfe and their family have hosted a <a href=\"http://runwithwolfes.org/golf-fore-wolfeold/\">Golf Fore Wolfe</a> in memory of son Eric, who loved golf, and whose catch line, “It’s always a great day for golf,’’ helps kick off the event at the Ironwood Country Club in Waukesha County.</p><p>Along with a companion event, <a href=\"http://runwithwolfes.org/\">Run With Wolfes</a>, started by Eric’s sister Cara Olson, the family has raised more than $1 million.</p><p>The family has donated the money to support research at the <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/47424\">UW Carbone Cancer</a> in Madison, where physicians took care of Eric during the five years he lived with brain cancer, which was diagnosed while he was a UW-Madison student.</p><p>There’s a strong UW alumni component to the events: sister Cara was a member of the Wisconsin pom squad (now called the dance team); her husband Rob Olson, was in marching band; and every year, a number of the golf foursomes are made up of Badger Marching Band alumni.</p><p>“Everyone in our family graduated from Wisconsin except me, I’m a Carroll College grad,’’ says Jerry Wolfe.</p><p>And everyone who attends becomes part of the extended Wolfe family. <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/paul-m-harari-md/6226\">Dr. Paul Harari</a>, chairman of Human Oncology, says that he has been touched how the Wolfes naturally support and encourage patients and other families who have lost loved ones to brain cancer, and make them part of the cause.</p><p>“The Wolfes are a tremendous example of people who have turned their own tragedy into an event that gives hope to so many others,’’ says Harari. “They have created a wonderful legacy for their son, and for our cancer patients in the future.”</p><p>In recent years, with the Wolfe fund nearing the $1 million mark, it has been used to support a promising young cancer researcher for fellowship training. The very first Eric Wolfe Fellow, <a href=\"https://www.humonc.wisc.edu/team_member/hima-bindu-musunuru-mbbs-mrcp-uk-frcr-uk/\">Dr. Hima “Bindu” Musunuru</a>, is currently in the second year of her radiation oncology research fellowship.</p><p>Dr. Musunuru’s research has focused on using radiation in a more targeted manner, to avoid harming healthy tissue surrounding the tumor, an issue that is especially important to brain-cancer patients. While she has been involved with projects involving several cancer types, her work with UW Carbone brain-cancer specialist <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/steven-p-howard-md-phd/6356\">Dr. Steven Howard</a> is aimed at delivering radiation in pulsed low doses to treat brain cancer that has returned after initial treatment.</p><p>“I have truly enjoyed this fellowship, which has given me an opportunity to develop unique clinical protocols involving targeted radiation therapy while minimizing side effects,’’ she says.</p><p>As for Jerry Wolfe, he remembers Dr. Howard as being part of the team that cared for Eric.</p><p>“They took care of him for five years, and that’s why I’m so committed to the UW Carbone Cancer Center,’’ he says.</p><p>Wolfe says that the 20th Golf for Wolfes will be his largest fundraiser, although he expects the event will continue in a less formal manner in years to come.</p><p>Dr. Harari laughs and acknowledges that Jerry Wolfe certainly deserves to slow down.</p><p>“Jerry has been telling me for years he is going to slow down,’’ Harari says. “However, I have seen no sign of it. He is like the energizer bunny. Have a hunch he may continue leveraging his enormous positive energy for years to come.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>It&#39;s all too easy to take our physical well-being for granted, especially for those fortunate enough to consistently feel well.</p><p>For Jean Rose-DeRenzy, an active woman from Canton, Ill., who spent decades as a neurology nurse, children&#39;s librarian, gardener and horse-riding enthusiast, life suddenly took a sudden turn for the worse not long after a horse-buying trip to Oklahoma in early 2016.</p><p>&quot;Two weeks after I came home, I was so weak and just couldn&#39;t do anything,&quot; she said. &quot;Within a few months, I was forced to retire after 35 years of nursing because I simply couldn&#39;t walk enough to perform my job.&quot;</p><p>Jean grew increasingly frustrated because every provider she saw locally could not pinpoint the problem. Her joint pain and swelling were assumed – mistakenly – as signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis, and she was treated accordingly. Her elevated calcium levels were treated with &quot;watchful waiting.&quot; Other symptoms, such as &quot;brain fog,&quot; increasing bone pain, intense itching of her trunk and rash outbreaks, left Jean and her husband, Dan, extremely frustrated.</p><p>Ultimately, Jean&#39;s culprit was finally identified in the fall of 2017 – 18 months after the onset of her debilitating symptoms. The problem was hyperparathyroidism, in which an overgrowth of one or more parathyroid glands triggers secretion of excess parathyroid hormone. This leads to a surplus of calcium in the bloodstream and many unwanted physical and mental symptoms.</p><h3>Why parathyroid glands are so important</h3><p>Although the parathyroid glands (each of us has four) and the thyroid gland (which regulates metabolism) have nothing to do with each other, they are often confused because their names sound similar and they are both located in the neck.</p><p>&quot;Our parathyroid glands are about the size of a grain of rice,&quot; said Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P8023</span>, the UW Health Endocrine Surgery division chief. &quot;They are incredibly important because they regulate the amount of calcium in our blood and bones. Since having the right amount of calcium at any given time is vital for proper function of multiple systems in the body, an overactive parathyroid gland, which produces excess parathyroid hormone, can be devastating to patients both physically and mentally.&quot;</p><p>Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism – many of which Jean experienced –  include:</p><ul><li><p>Fragile bones that fracture easily</p></li><li><p>Kidney stones</p></li><li><p>Weakness and low stamina</p></li><li><p>Bone, muscle and joint pain</p></li><li><p>Abdominal pain</p></li><li><p>Forgetfulness and &quot;brain fog&quot;</p></li><li><p>Depression</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, even a slightly elevated level of calcium can be a sign of trouble.</p><p>&quot;Historically, some providers downplayed mild calcium elevation as a concern,&quot; Dr. Sippel said. &quot;Yet even a mild elevation in calcium levels can lead to fairly significant symptoms for some patients.&quot;</p><h3>Surgery is the only cure for hyperparathyroidism</h3><p>Surgery to remove an overactive parathyroid – typically done on an outpatient basis – is the only way to treat the condition. Once it is performed, Dr. Sippel said most patients experience improvement or resolution of at least 60 to 70 percent of their symptoms.</p><p>&quot;Many patients, including Jean, describe it as life-changing,&quot; Dr. Sippel said. &quot;Their mood, energy level and ability to concentrate typically improve significantly, and they just feel so much better.&quot;</p><p>For Jean, the journey to a better life included a few detours. It was not until her third parathyroid surgery – one in Illinois and two at UW Health – that the overactive parathyroid was found.</p><p>&quot;My bad parathyroid was hard to locate because it was hidden within my thyroid gland,&quot; Jean said. &quot;Even after Dr. Sippel could not find it the first time she operated, she refused to give up and ultimately removed it the second time after a biopsy and additional imaging revealed its hidden location.&quot;</p><h3>Highly impressed with the UW Health experience</h3><p>Shortly after her successful surgery in December 2018, Jean wrote a letter to UW Health praising Dr. Sippel and her team and expressing gratitude for the excellent care, communication and family-focused approach they exhibit.</p><p>&quot;People often only take the time to express themselves when they have a complaint,&quot; Jean said. &quot;I wanted everyone to know how much not only I, but also my husband appreciated the many ways UW Health made this experience so positive.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Sippel&#39;s team, which attracts hyperparathyroidism patients from near and far, prides itself on making the process work smoothly.</p><p>The team&#39;s clinical program coordinator, Ann Arnold, RN-BC, MSN, takes her time with each patient; nobody feels rushed.</p><p>&quot;I help our patients navigate our system, gather necessary medical records and images, coordinate studies and appointments, educate them on their disease and next steps, and answer all questions and concerns,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;For patients like Jean, who seek out our program from long distances, we aim to get this legwork done in advance. If possible, we offer these patients the opportunity to get their consult and surgery done in two days with just one trip to Madison. In the end, we want our patients to have a remarkable experience that allows them to focus on healing and enjoying a better life.&quot;</p><h3>How to reach the UW Health Endocrine Surgery Clinic</h3><p>Dr. Sippel encourages anyone searching for answers after experiencing the symptoms mentioned above to learn more about <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 14484</span> or call the UW Health Endocrine Surgery Clinic at (608) 242-2888.</p><p>&quot;Hyperparathyroidism is often underdiagnosed and untreated,&quot; she said. &quot;We want to help people get better, because too many patients suffer needlessly, or they just assume – mistakenly – that their symptoms have more to do with aging.&quot;</p><p>Accordingly, Dr. Sippel and her team do a lot of physician-to-physician communication on the topic, helping increase awareness of hyperparathyroidism among both community providers and patients.</p><p>&quot;We just want more people to have a much higher quality of life – even if someone else has told them they have to just deal with their symptoms,&quot; she said.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Glen Melby is happy to discuss potential benefits of clinical trials with just about anyone, because he has experienced those benefits. Twice.</p><p>Melby was first diagnosed with non-small cell <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 13226</span> (NSCLC) in 2008. He began radiation and chemotherapy, and while treatments eliminated most evidence of the disease, he said side effects were nearly unbearable. A year later, the cancer was back.</p><p>It was then Dr. Walter Vogel, his oncologist at the Beloit Cancer Center, mentioned a possible new treatment option. Based on the results of an NSCLC clinical trial, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had just months prior fast-tracked the approval of a targeted drug therapy, Crizotinib, for patients whose tumors had a mutation in the ALK gene. Melby’s tumor was sequenced and found to be one of the roughly 4 percent of NSCLCs that are ALK+. He began taking Crizotonib almost immediately.</p><p>“You just don’t see oncologists be giddy, but after Glen’s first PET scan after he started the drug, Dr. Vogel was,” said Dianne Melby, Glen’s wife.</p><p>For nearly two years, Melby took Crizotonib, an oral drug that targets ALK-mutated cancer cells and therefore has fewer side effects than standard chemotherapy.</p><p>However, his cancer grew resistant to Crizotonib, and Vogel referred Melby to Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7750</span> at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15041</span>. Traynor offered him an option to enroll in a clinical trial to investigate a next-generation ALK-targeted therapy, Alectinib.</p><p>“After having such success with Crizotinib, stepping into this trial was a no-brainer for me,” Melby said.</p><p>He began the trial in February 2014. While his cancer is still detectable by scans, there has been no further advancement of the disease.</p><p>“This drug has been wonderful for me,” Melby said. “The fact that side effects are minimal, the fact that I go on with my life, I go to Florida to see my grandkids. It’s been over seven years since I was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, and I’m still here.”</p><p>Traynor noted future patients would benefit from Melby’s participation in the Alectinib trial, just as he had benefitted from those who had enrolled in the Crozotinib trial.</p><p>“Without brave patients like Glen enrolling in trials, cancer science cannot move forward,” Traynor said.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Caitlin Tobin has been blessed in countless ways – perhaps no more so than with an uncanny ability to knock down any obstacle in her way. </p><p>To be sure, Caitlin is incredibly charming and poised, but her drive and relentless determination are unmistakable. So is her constant concern for others.</p><p>She might be small – 4-foot-3, to be exact – but she is mighty. Most people simply think she is a little person and that’s just fine with Caitlin. Behind the “curtain” however, lies a complex medical history that is known only to family and a few close friends.</p><p>“I don’t talk much about it because I want people to know me for me – not my disability, surgeries or hospital stays,” she said.</p><p>What puts a big smile on Caitlin’s face is anything relating to education – not only her own, which includes a looming graduation from Cornell College (Iowa) with majors in English Literature and American History – but the need to treat schooling as a right for all children, especially those with disabilities.</p><p>Slated to begin graduate school this fall, Caitlin hopes to earn a Master of Library Science and ultimately a Ph.D. in children’s literature. Having spent so much time as a child healing, she occupied herself by reading constantly. The library was kind of her nearby Disney World.</p><p>“That’s where I could just let myself be me,” she says. “I hate to see libraries being de-funded because every kid needs a space like that, especially those who, like me, couldn’t do a lot of other things.”</p><h3>Something was wrong at birth</h3><p>Without a hint of a problem during her mother&#39;s pregnancy, Caitlin’s long healthcare story began at birth, when something clearly was wrong with her legs. “They didn’t look normal and would not move at all,” said Caitlin’s mother, Aimee Tobin of Madison.</p><p>After their baby was whisked away for batteries of scans, X-rays and tests, Aimee, her husband Dave and Caitlin soon became “frequent fliers” at American Family Children’s Hospital and its predecessor, UW Children’s Hospital.</p><p>“Caitlin has a rare combination of spinal deformities known as spina bifida occulta with spondyloptosis,” said <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6392</span>, MD, a UW Health pediatric neurosurgeon who has known Caitlin since birth.</p><p>When Caitlin was just 5 weeks old, Dr. Iskandar performed a complex lumbar fusion operation on Caitlin, which included untethering her spinal cord. Her recovery was lengthy and included support from a ventilator for 11 days. To ensure proper healing, she wore a cast that spanned from her armpits to her toes.</p><p>“Since Caitlin was so small and her bone so immature, we had to use suture material instead of metal to hold her bone together,” Dr. Iskandar said. “I was convinced we would have to go back and operate again months or years later, but thankfully this was not the case.”</p><p>Many other pediatric specialists soon entered the Tobins’ world, including orthopedic surgeons, endocrinologists, urologists and rehabilitation specialists.</p><p>At one point, the Tobins were told it was unlikely Caitlin would ever move her legs. Her cognitive abilities were not impacted, but they didn’t yet know this for sure when she was a baby.</p><p>“When Caitlin was 2, Dr. Iskandar told us they knew about 80 percent of what was wrong with Caitlin, but the other 20 percent would consist of surprises,” Aimee said.</p><p>Caitlin apparently took Dr. Iskandar’s words to heart in the best sense, because she has defied the odds repeatedly – usually making her parents extremely proud, but occasionally a little peeved by her stubbornness.</p><h3>A stubborn streak helped her defy the odds</h3><p>With the help of a walker, Caitlin took her first steps around age 2½. By age 5, she ditched the walker and crutches except for longer distances. To improve her mobility, Caitlin underwent several hip, leg and foot surgeries by the time she turned 8.</p><p>“The first one I remember was a hip surgery in second grade,” Caitlin said. “I couldn’t move for two months. My hair, which was quite long, got very matted. My grandma brushed it out, but it was so gross.</p><p>With plenty of help from her parents and grandparents, Caitlin stayed on top of her schoolwork throughout elementary and middle school. A huge setback, however, befell her during junior year of high school. A tear in her left hip cartilage – combined with persistent pain on her right side – made it impossible for Caitlin to walk. The pain was excruciating.</p><p>“This required major surgery during which the orthopedic surgeon repaired the torn cartilage and reconstructed the hip bone – all to get her walking again,” Aimee said. “Unfortunately, the recovery was very long, and she was pretty miserable.”</p><p>Caitlin’s friends were focused on graduation and college applications. Meanwhile, she said, “I’m wondering if I’ll ever walk again.” It took a year, but Caitlin finally recovered and resumed walking. She also has a wheelchair, which she uses intermittently to this day.</p><p>When they think back on the past 21 years, Aimee and Dave are incredibly grateful for the care Caitlin received from so many UW Health physicians, nurses and therapists.</p><p>“Everyone at UW helped soften the blow – not just for Caitlin but for us,” Aimee said. “Dave and I are form Maryland and had always planned to move back, but once Caitlin was born, we couldn’t even think of leaving her care team in Madison.”</p><h3>To stay or leave for college?</h3><p>An incredibly gifted student, Caitlin naturally pursued college plans. Her parents heartily approved, but – being nervous about the idea of their daughter functioning independently – only if she stayed in Madison.</p><p>“I really wanted to go away to school,” Caitlin says. “I found a small school in Mount Vernon, Iowa – Cornell College – and I just fell in love with it. My mom and dad took me for a visit, assuming I’d see how impractical it would be to live 2½ hours from home with my disability.”</p><p>Caitlin wanted to test herself and get out of her comfort zone. Aimee, in particular, resisted until she finally ran out of reasons not to let Caitlin go away to school. “When you have a kid with a chronic medical condition who keeps beating the odds, you give in on some things,” Aimee said.</p><p>Caitlin got her wish. The challenges, however, surfaced immediately.</p><p>“I was nervous. I was homesick, especially the first semester,” she says. “As much as I wanted to push myself, I also worried about getting hurt or sick or having to go home. I also need to plan ahead because many places are still not accessible for disabled people. And then my mom made me text her after every meal because I have a life-threatening food allergy.” The texts were cryptic – <i>I’m alive and I ate</i> – but got the job done.</p><p>By sophomore year, things improved dramatically. She found her people and her growing sense of independence. As a junior, she was driving her own Honda Fit around town and across state lines, thanks to Dad’s addition of pedal extenders and seat cushions to compensate for her size.</p><h3>Leaving was best decision for the long term</h3><p>Now a senior, Caitlin knows that leaving Madison was the best decision she ever made.</p><p>“I just love my school,” she said. “I also know that getting a few hours away from home gave me the confidence I need to take on the challenges I will face throughout my life.”</p><p>Caitlin’s younger brother, Jack, a Madison West High School senior, treasures the close relationship with his sister, whom he never thought of as “different.”</p><p>“People ask me what it’s like growing up with a sister who is disabled,” he says. “I tell them, &#39;I don&#39;t know.&#39; &quot;</p><p>In addition to maintaining a near-perfect GPA in college, Caitlin is editor-in-chief of the literary magazine, plays oboe in the band and orchestra, works in the writing studio and volunteers at a local elementary school.</p><p>While COVID-19 has temporarily put her college graduation (and Jack&#39;s high school commencement) on hold, Caitlin is excited about what lies ahead.</p><p>“I don’t mind being a role model for other kids with disabilities,” she says. “If your disability motivates you to work even harder to be viewed for your ability rather than your disability, there are no limits to what you can achieve.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>If Colton Maron is not a premier example of lifelong resilience, it would be hard to find someone who better fits that description.</p><p>Now 22, Colton has faced many health obstacles since birth that have affected him physically, mentally and emotionally. While it would be easy to feel defeated, Colton has confronted each challenge with a smile on his face and a can-do attitude. After 23 surgeries – half of them by age 10 – along with thousands of hormone injections, and a very conspicuous halo brace he wore for three months, the worst appears to be behind him.</p><p>If all goes as planned, however, Colton will receive a college certificate as a Kitchen Steward in May 2020 that should be a ticket to a restaurant job performing his favorite activity -- cooking. Considering everything he has endured, that moment may instill a lump in the throat and endless joy in the hearts of so many who have been pulling for Colton.</p><p>Within minutes after he was born in June 1997, it was obvious that Colton had several physical abnormalities. Doctors immediately noticed a vertical cleft, or split, in the center of his upper lip and palate. These are rare conditions in which the upper lip does not form completely, and the roof of the mouth does not fully close. By themselves, the clefts would have been plenty to worry about, but they were just the beginning of Colton’s troubles.</p><p>“Colton had trouble breathing right away,” says his mother, Laura Maron. “An hour after he was born, he was taken by Med Flight from our hometown hospital in Beaver Dam to Madison.”</p><p>Colton spent his first month of life being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at UnityPoint Health – Meriter in Madison. There, UW Health pediatric specialists in plastic surgery, endocrinology, ophthalmology and other disciplines would tend to him.</p><p>In addition to the cleft lip and palate, doctors soon identified two more serious physical defects.</p><p>First, Colton’s pituitary gland – located under the brain and behind the bridge of the nose – did not develop properly, resulting in a condition called <b>panhypopituitarism</b>. Because a normal pituitary gland (often called the body’s “master gland”) produces several hormones that regulate human growth, sexual development, metabolism, stress response and other essential functions, it is considered vital. Unable to produce these hormones himself, Colton began receiving them through injections and tablets – and has been doing so his whole life.</p><p>Second, Colton’s optic nerve, located in the back of the eye, was damaged. This condition, known as optic nerve hypoplasia, considerably impairs Colton’s vision by disrupting the connection between his eye and brain. He has no depth perception or peripheral vision. He also has trouble distinguishing between related colors and has some related visual processing deficits.</p><h3>Not sure Colton would survive after birth</h3><p>“When Colton was born, they did so many tests,” Laura recalls,” and we didn’t know if he would even survive. They actually did a scan to see if he literally had any brain matter.”</p><p>Despite all the difficult news, Laura and her husband, Brent, were encouraged that several other potential problems were ruled out. It was going to be tough, but fortunately, their son was going to live.</p><p>The Marons clearly needed good health insurance, so Laura returned to teaching in Waupun when Colton was six months old. Knowing that Colton would need full-time parental care, Brent quit work as an appliance technician and stayed home with Colton until he started kindergarten at age 6. Grandparents, friends and other family members pitched in constantly to help.</p><h3>An endless string of surgeries</h3><p>Most kids born with a cleft lip and palate require six to eight surgeries before the repair is complete – about one-third as many as Colton. His first operation, done at four months of age, closed the gap in his lip, allowing him to drink out of a bottle. The Marons would come to know every bump in the road between Beaver Dam and Madison, returning for countless hospitalizations and clinic visits at UW Health’s American Family Children’s Hospital.</p><p>From infancy through high school, Colton had surgeries to:</p><ul><li><p>Continue repairing his lip and palate</p></li><li><p>Secure his eye after it looked like it was “floating”</p></li><li><p>Put tubes in his ears (and replace them many times) to help drainage</p></li><li><p>Fix a flap in the back of his throat</p></li><li><p>Treat his sinuses to allow more nasal space</p></li><li><p>Remove his tonsils and adenoids</p></li><li><p>Remove nine teeth to make room for his permanent teeth</p></li><li><p>Put a piece of bone from his hip into his jaw</p></li><li><p>Straighten his nose</p></li><li><p>Re-align his upper jaw one inch forward by breaking both jaws</p></li></ul><p>UW Health pediatric plastic surgeon Delora Mount, MD, who performed all of Colton’s surgeries since he was 5, said the goal was to properly align his jaw to allow for normal biting and chewing.</p><p>“Colton’s case is one of the most challenging we have seen in my 18 years here,” says Dr. Mount. “Thankfully, his family has been there every step of the way to support him, and that is so crucial for achieving the best outcomes.”</p><h3>Halo provided maximum jaw alignment</h3><p>Because of his unusual jaw anatomy, Dr. Mount could only do so much through normal surgery. Knowing his bite still needed better alignment, she proposed that Colton wear a halo device that allows for more precise fine-tuning. At first, Colton did not feel ready to wear a metal device around his head.</p><p>By age 20, however, Colton was tired of people staring at his abnormal face. He was ready for the halo, and would undergo a complex, 6-hour surgery to have it installed.</p><p>In early 2018, Colton wore the halo 24/7 for three months. During that time, he consumed only liquids – mostly smoothies and soups. He slept in a recliner, using a horseshoe-shaped pillow to keep his head propped. When the halo finally came off, the news was everything he had dreamed.</p><p>For the first time ever, Colton could close his mouth and feel his lips and teeth come together in the right place. He could finally bite with his front teeth. Sleeping improved considerably, and his smile looked natural.</p><h3>Pituitary Deficiency Presented More Challenges</h3><p>Colton’s pituitary problem kept giving his caregivers more medical challenges.</p><p>“The pituitary gland actually develops from the tissue that also forms the roof of the mouth,” says UW Health pediatric endocrinologist David Allen, MD. “That’s why we are concerned about possible pituitary function problems with children are born with facial issues like Colton’s.”</p><p>Dr. Allen says children with a non-working pituitary gland must receive key hormone treatments without fail from their family or things could go downhill very quickly.</p><p>“It’s not like missing a dose of an over-the-counter pain reliever,” he says. </p><p>Despite recently “graduating” from pediatric to adult care, Colton will always have a very special place in the hearts of the UW Health pediatric endocrinology team members.</p><p>“Colton is an incredibly warm and sensitive person who has developed into an impressive young man,” says Dr. Allen, “He has faced these challenges so resiliently with a loving, supportive family right beside him.</p><p>Jan Lehmann, RN, a retired pediatric endocrinology nurse, remembers Colton and his family very fondly.</p><p>“I was so thrilled when he invited me to his high school graduation party,” she says. “He is such a great kid who always came to the clinic with a smile on his face.&quot;</p><p>“Everything about Colton personifies bravery,” she says. “Think about having more than 20 surgeries and taking all of the hormone injections. And then going out in public with a halo in front of his face – that really took courage.”</p><p>It also takes courage to go scuba diving – a lifelong dream of Colton’s that had to wait because doctors were concerned about the pressure on his ears and his ability to breathe properly.</p><p>Finally, his medical team gave him permission to train. After training with his dad, Colton completed his performance dives and received his Open Water Diver certification on August 18, 2019.</p><p>“This truly means the world to Colton,” says Laura. “We are so proud of him!”</p>",

      "story": "<p>If life is what happens while you’re busy making other plans, 20-year-old Josie Gotz has already known the true definition of life many times over.</p><p>While employed as a certified nursing assistant at a local rehabilitation facility, Josie’s function on her right side started to disappear little by little.</p><p>She had just turned 19 and finished her first year at Northcentral Technical College in Wausau, Wis. She first noticed weakness in her hand. Sometimes it would tingle; other times it would feel numb. Later, her foot started to drag; she could not pick it up when she walked. Her toes would drop and she felt at any time that she might stumble. Josie also began losing vision in her right eye.</p><p>Within a few weeks, Josie’s life – and that of her family – was turned upside down by a devastating diagnosis. Josie had a brain tumor.</p><p>First, it was described as the size of a pea. Further analysis revealed that it might be the size of a golf ball. Finally, Josie was told it was almost as large as a tennis ball.</p><p>“When you hear &#39;tennis ball,&#39; &quot; said Josie&#39;s mother, Sarah Gotz, &quot;you know it’s bad.&quot;</p><p>And when you also hear the word &quot;inoperable,&quot; as the Gotz family did at a local hospital, life becomes incredibly dark in a hurry.</p><p>“I just kind of broke down,&quot; Josie said. &quot;I was in shock and didn’t really know what to do or say.&quot;</p><h3>News kept getting worse</h3><p>No matter where the Gotz family went for answers, the news seemed to just get worse.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s an inoperable tumor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She could have chemotherapy and radiation, but the prognosis is poor.&quot;</p><p>&quot;She will lose her vision, speech and hearing.&quot;</p><p>Despite this very bleak outlook, the Gotzes refused to give up.</p><p>&quot;We had to keep looking, because we just would not accept &#39;inoperable,&#39; &quot; Sarah said.</p><p>Fortunately, a ray of hope was waiting in Madison, Wis. – a 4½-hour drive from the Gotzes&#39; hometown of Park Falls in the northern part of the state.</p><h3>UW Health neurosurgeon offers hope</h3><p>One of Sarah&#39;s co-workers strongly suggested getting a second opinion and happened to know about UW Health neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5472</span>, MD. The Gotzes wasted no time before they contacted him at University Hospital in Madison.</p><p>Knowing the urgency of Josie’s situation, Dr. Baskaya and his nurse practitioner, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6071</span>, NP, cleared time on the calendar to see Josie a few days later.</p><p>Dr. Baskaya made the long drive worthwhile by offering Josie and her family something that had eluded them for months: Hope.</p><p>“I can operate on you,” Dr. Baskaya told Josie, &quot;but I want you to know up front there will be consequences that will limit your hand and foot function, especially for the first year.&quot;</p><p>Consequences or not, Josie and Sarah immediately burst into tears of joy. Dr. Baskaya, as he does for many patients who come feeling hopeless, offered the Gotzes the first piece of good news since Josie got sick.</p><p>“We knew Josie would not get back to 100 percent,&quot; Sarah said, &quot;but surgery with Dr. Baskaya was her only chance for something reasonably close to a normal life.&quot;</p><h3>Surgery performed in two stages</h3><p>Ten days later, Josie was taken to the operating room. There, Dr. Baskaya and his team worked for 14 hours to cut out her 4.4-centimeter tumor, known as a thalamic astrocytoma – meaning it was in the brain&#39;s supportive tissues. As grade II, Josie&#39;s tumor is considered low-grade on a severity scale of I to IV.</p><p>“Sitting in the waiting area that day was not easy when as a mom, you want to know it all,&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Thankfully we had pagers that sent us short messages like ‘Surgery started,’ or ‘In surgery - doing well.’ Finally, Dr. Baskaya came out and told us he removed as much of Josie’s tumor as he could without risking further damage and would perform a second surgery a month later to go after the remaining tumor.&quot;</p><p>Josie was a shell of her former self in those first days after surgery. In addition to temporarily losing half her vision and all of her hearing in one ear, she couldn’t talk at first. When she started speaking a few days later, she sounded like a 3-year-old child. It would take two weeks of inpatient rehabilitation followed by months of occupational and physical therapy before she began sounding like the young woman she was.</p><h3>Josie starts coming back</h3><p>Eight months later, after shedding her leg and foot braces, a wheelchair and a cane, Josie is regaining movement in her right hand. Physically, she is about 75 percent of the way back, and completely back to her old self mentally. For Josie’s safety, Dr. Baskaya had to leave a very small piece of the tumor, but the hope is that Josie will enjoy a long, happy life before any chance of recurrence.</p><p>&quot;You need to plan for a long, long future,&quot; Dr. Baskaya told Josie at one of her recent appointments.</p><p>For now, Josie’s calendar is filled with doctor appointments, PT and OT sessions – and enjoying the miracle of life Dr. Baskaya gave her.</p><p>A few of Josie’s friends might have dropped off the radar, but most have been extremely supportive through thick and thin.</p><p>&quot;They kept me sane,&quot; Josie says.</p><p>Josie might not be the same as before, but she and her family can&#39;t overstate how grateful they are that she is alive and getting stronger each day.</p><p>“One of the things we love about Dr. Baskaya is that he never said everything would be just fine,&quot; Sarah said. “He didn’t raise our expectations, but he gave Josie life and our family hope when we didn’t think either were possible.”</p>",

      "story": "<p>The story about <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/47424\">UW Carbone</a> patient Stephanie Herfel and her cancer-sniffing husky dog, Sierra, has gone viral since the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on it in early December.</p><p>Since then, the story of how Sierra sniffed out Stephanie’s ovarian cancer has gone around the globe. She’s had interview offers from Dr. Oz, The Now, local television in Madison, and is going to Nashville with her husband, Jim, and Sierra, to tape an episode of the Pickler &amp; Ben show.</p><p>“I’m just trying to ride the wave,’’ says Stephanie, who set up a new email account to manage all the inquiries. “My message is to get your symptoms checked out, I hope that I could save another women’s life.&quot;</p><p>In case you missed it, here’s the short version. Herfel, 52, inherited Sierra in 2011 when her son, Sean Perez, joined the U.S. Air Force. In autumn 2013, shortly after she moved from California to Madison, she started experiencing the whispering symptoms of ovarian cancer, including pain and bloating in her lower abdomen. She went to the emergency room but was told that it was likely a benign ovarian cyst.</p><p>Sierra thought different.</p><p>“She put her nose on my lower belly and was sniffing me so intently I thought I had spilled food on my shirt,’’ Stephanie remembers.</p><p> But then the dog ran and hid, as if she were upset, and curled into a ball in the back of the closet, like she was afraid.</p><p>That reaction caused Herfel to get another opinion.</p><p>“I would not be here today if she didn’t react like that,’’ Herfel says. “That’s why I made the appointment.”</p><p>The second opinion appointment led her to <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/david-m-kushner-md/6644\">Dr. David Kushner</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/47424\">UW Carbone Cancer Center</a>. He confirmed that she did indeed have stage 3C ovarian cancer. He did surgery to remove her spleen and a performed a complete hysterectomy. Herfel had chemotherapy, and was doing well until 2015, when Sierra again began sniffing and acting frightened. The same thing happened in 2016, and both times scans confirmed that her cancer had returned.</p><p>“Three times is amazing,’’ she says. “It just triples the amazement.” </p><p>It turns out that her doctors aren’t surprised to hear that the dog has powers of detection. Dogs have 220 million <i>olfactory</i> receptors in their noses, compared with 5 million for humans, and the part of their brains devoted to smell is also much larger.</p><p>“It’s believable,’’ says <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/howard-h-bailey-md/5442\">Dr. Howard Bailey</a>, Carbone Cancer Center director and one of Herfel’s oncologists. “It comes down to proteomics or the study of proteins. Cancer occurs and advances based on some of the abnormal proteins it produces and differing smells are often a result of different proteins. So it’s not surprising that dogs, which are much more sensitive to smell than we are, could detect a change.”</p><p>Stephanie, on the right holding Sierra, with Dr. David Kushner, poses with her family at a Wisconsin Ovarian Cancer Alliance walk.</p><p>But while Sierra gets credit for the first detection, it’s some cutting-edge research that is keeping Stephanie going.</p><p>When her cancer returned in 2016, Dr. Kushner suggested that she enroll in a clinical trial that included of a new type of targeted cancer-fighting drug called a PARP inhibitor. Earlier trials showed these drugs work especially well in patients such as Herfel, who have the BRCA mutation, which is inherited and can drive both ovarian and breast cancers.</p><p>PARP inhibitors work by interfering with the cancer cells’ ability to repair their damaged DNA, leading to cell death. The BRCA gene makes those cancer cells especially vulnerable to this class of drugs. Earlier this year they were approved by the FDA, thanks to women like Stephanie who participated in clinical trials.</p><p>“That made all the difference in the world to her,’’ says Dr. Kushner. “It’s amazing that one of the first targeted therapy for ovarian cancer became available just as she needed it.”</p><p>So far, the drugs are keeping her cancer from progressing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sierra is getting some help at home, too. Herfel says the dog is so attached to her that she would panic, and even have seizures, when Herfel would leave for doctor’s appointments. So the Herfels got her a “little brother,” a little fluffy guy named Gizmo who keeps Sierra company.</p><p>“Sierra is so bonded to me,’’ Herfel says. “When I’m sad, she’ll lick my tears off, and she always places herself between me and the doorway, to protect me.”</p><p>And now Sierra will be making the rounds of television appearances, and perhaps helping save more women with early symptoms of ovarian cancer. </p>",

      "story": "<p>Barbara Ellingson-Raisbeck wasn&#39;t looking forward to the day she had to return her two grandchildren, ages 5 and 7, back home to their mom and dad.</p><p>After spending 10 days with grandma and grandpa at their northern Wisconsin home during the summer of 2019, the time came to pack everything up for the 4½-hour drive from Sugar Camp, Wis., to Brooklyn and Devin&#39;s home in Rockford, Ill.\r</p><p>&quot;My husband, Tom, and I had so much fun entertaining our grandkids,&quot; Barbara said. &quot;It&#39;s always kind of a letdown when we have to take them back.&quot;\r</p><p>With so many &quot;treasures&quot; filling the car – courtesy of their grandparents – there was not enough room for four occupants, so Tom stayed home while Barbara drove the grandkids home.\r</p><p>Just before backing out of the driveway, however, Barbara had a premonition.\r</p><p>&quot;Am I going to make it all the way?&quot; she asked herself. Her doubt would prove to be rather prescient.\r</p><p>Barbara and the two children headed out, making a brief stop for lunch. As they resumed their travels, a nasty windstorm kicked up with an intensity so fierce that many drivers, including Barbara, pulled over to wait things out.\r</p><p>&quot;The storm will soon pass and we will be fine,&quot; she reassured the children.\r</p><p>After resuming the drive south, Barbara was suddenly overcome by an inexplicable medical emergency. Thankfully, she was able to safely stop the car alongside the highway. She also decided to make a phone call that may have saved her life.\r</p><h3>&#39;Hang on to Grandma&#39;s arm&#39;</h3><p>&quot;I could only see the color white,&quot; she says. &quot;It was very scary. I reached my arm across the seat and grabbed the hands of my grandkids. I told them, &#39;Hang on to Grandma&#39;s arm. Grandma needs to call 911, but we&#39;re going to get through this.&#39; &quot;</p><p>Barbara couldn&#39;t say exactly where she was but knew enough to tell the 911 operator she was near Plover, Wis. She vomited a few times, maintained consciousness, but within minutes found herself slumped over the steering wheel. Later that day, doctors would confirm that Barbara had a ruptured brain aneurysm – the bursting of a blood vessel inside the brain.\r</p><p>&quot;I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but Devin, my 5-year-old grandson, was rubbing my back trying to wake me up,&quot; she said.\r</p><p>&quot;Grandma wouldn&#39;t listen to me,&quot; Devin later told his parents.\r</p><p>Fortunately, an ambulance soon arrived. The officer knocked on the window, urging the children to unlock the door so they could attend to Barbara.\r</p><h3>Taken to Stevens Point Hospital, then to Madison\r</h3><p>As soon as the three passengers were safely placed in the ambulance, they were taken to the nearest hospital, Aspirus Stevens Point, where Barbara&#39;s husband, Tom, would arrive and stay with the kids until their father could pick them up.\r</p><p>&quot;They put the kids in a room at the hospital, and thankfully they were able to do some coloring and be content,&quot; Barbara says.\r</p><p>An MRI revealed something of great concern on Barbara&#39;s brain, meaning she would need to be rushed by ambulance to University Hospital in Madison.\r</p><p>&quot;My son Jeff – Brooklyn and Devin&#39;s dad – was heading north on I-39 to pick up his kids,&quot; Barbara said. &quot;He remembers passing a southbound ambulance thinking it was probably me.&quot;\r</p><p>Minutes after Barbara&#39;s ambulance arrived at UW Health&#39;s Emergency Department, her oldest son Brian and his wife Kirsten from nearby Cottage Grove got to the hospital.\r</p><p>&quot;We were shocked to see Mom awake, talking with the doctors and nurses,&quot; Brian recalls. &quot;Given the severity of an aneurysm rupture, they thought her alertness at the time was a good sign.&quot;\r</p><p>After Barbara underwent a few tests to confirm the aneurysm and its location, UW Health neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9219</span>, MD, came in to say he would need to do surgery right away to ensure it would not start bleeding again. Her husband, Tom, arrived just in time to see Barbara taken to the operating room.\r</p><h3>Immediate surgery stopped brain bleed\r</h3><p>To access the aneurysm, Dr. Ahmed began by removing a piece of Barbara&#39;s skull – specifically a piece of bone reaching from the middle of her nose to the back of her ear.\r</p><p>&quot;After we clip the aneurysm to prevent future bleeding, I would typically put the piece of skull back right away,&quot; Dr. Ahmed said. &quot;Because Barbara had so much swelling, however, we had to close her up in July and have her come back for one more surgery in September, when we reattached the stored piece of bone to her skull with titanium plates and screws.&quot;\r</p><p>After the second surgery to restore the piece of bone, Barbara&#39;s head looked completely normal again.\r</p><p>&quot;You really can&#39;t tell that she had a big piece of bone removed,&quot; Brian said. &quot;She has a nice round head like you and me.&quot;\r</p><p>At 65, Barbara shows little sign of slowing down. She works part-time at a hotel and loves staying busy in Wisconsin&#39;s north woods.\r</p><p>She also thinks every day about how lucky she was to avoid a far more serious fate.\r</p><p>Her son Brian wonders if his mother would have even called for help had she not been driving with her two grandchildren.\r</p><h3>Calling 911 probably saved her life\r</h3><p>&quot;Who knows if she would have just lay down if her symptoms happened at home?&quot; Brian wonders. &quot;I think being on the road with her grandkids heightened the sense of urgency.&quot;\r</p><p>Barbara isn&#39;t exactly sure what made her call 911, but she has four words that everyone should live by if ever in doubt: Listen to Your Body.\r</p><p>&quot;How did I even know I was supposed to call 911?&quot; Barbara said. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I just did. As I told my son, &#39;I wasn&#39;t ready to go.&#39; &quot;\r</p>",

      "story": "<p>Lori Pedretti was terrified.</p><p>Her 43-year-old husband, Gary, was living with a brain tumor that not one, but two physicians would not operate on because – they said – surgery was too dangerous. Because of the tumor’s location, they believed that surgery would put Gary at high risk for a stroke or loss of vision or hearing.</p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that the Pedrettis, of Westby, Wis., felt hopeless, knowing that Gary had a brain tumor that could not be removed.</p><p>&quot;Our daughter was only 3 at the time,&quot; said Lori, &quot;and here I am wondering if I will soon be raising her without her father.&quot;</p><p>The tumor was also causing Gary to have seizures. The first one was a grand mal seizure in April 2015. Later that year, he had mini-seizures which were increasing in frequency.</p><p>&quot;It got to the point where Gary was having a seizure every night, just as he was falling asleep,&quot; Lori said. &quot;I would lie in bed stiff as a board dreading what I knew was coming.&quot;</p><h3>Wife learned about Dr. Baskaya as if it were fate</h3><p><b> </b>A registered nurse for 10 years, Lori was pursuing a master’s degree at the time from Viterbo University in La Crosse, Wis. She almost skipped class one night because she was afraid to leave Gary home alone, but she forced herself out the door – a decision that might have saved her husband’s life.</p><p>Sitting next to Lori in class that evening was another Lori – Lori Slattery, who at the time was Director of the Aspirus UW Cancer Center in Wisconsin Rapids.</p><p>The two Loris had a chance to meet and talk, and Lori Slattery recalls the conversation vividly.</p><p>“Lori Pedretti was telling me about her husband,” Slattery said. “I asked if Gary was considering another opinion, because a few days earlier, our cancer center hosted UW Health neurosurgeon <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P5472</span>, MD, who spoke to our clinicians about treatment of brain cancer and the neurological system. His presentation was so impressive that I shared his name with Lori Pedretti, who wasted little time by calling Dr. Baskaya’s office the next morning.&quot;</p><p>Baskaya&#39;s nurse practitioner, <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6071</span>, NP, reviewed Gary’s records and asked the Pedrettis to come to Madison as soon as they could.</p><h3>Finally, hope seemed possible</h3><p>After feeling lost for months, Gary and Lori began to feel that hope was truly possible.</p><p>&quot;Dr. Baskaya put my wife and me at ease within just a few minutes of meeting him,” Gary said. &quot;We knew right away that he was the one who would be able to help me.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Baskaya’s manner, Lori recalls, was incredibly reassuring.</p><p>“He is very confident and comforting, without being arrogant – and we had seen arrogance before,” Lori said.</p><p>Best of all, Dr. Baskaya told the Pedrettis that he would operate on Gary. While unable to give them a guarantee, Dr. Baskaya told Gary he was 90 percent confident that there would be a good outcome. He also cleared his calendar so that just four days later, Gary was taken into the operating room at UW Health.</p><p>“Not only is Dr. Baskaya an incredibly gifted surgeon, but he uses advanced technologies such as intraoperative MRI, high-tech surgical microscopes with special dyes and motor-evoked potential recording to ensure he can remove as much tumor as possible without causing damage to parts of the brain that control motor skills,” said Geanon, his nurse practitioner. &quot;It helps him ensure that patient safety is the highest priority, and it certainly was in Gary’s case.&quot;</p><p>When Dr. Baskaya came out of surgery, he approached Lori with the news. </p><h3>Entire tumor removed</h3><p>“Gary had a Grade II astrocytoma, and I was able to resect this tumor gross totally,” said Dr. Baskaya, meaning that every bit of tumor he could see on MRI or under the surgical microscope was removed. “Everything went well.”</p><p>Despite flying to his native Turkey for Christmas just a few days later, Dr. Baskaya stayed in touch with Letty to be sure that Gary was recovering well in the days and weeks after surgery.</p><p>“Dr. Baskaya is 24/7,&quot; Geanon said. &quot;He will answer a call in the middle of the night, whether he’s here or out of the country to ensure that patients like Gary are given the very best care.&quot;</p><p>Gary, who helps install new water and sewer mains for a Wisconsin-based company, is in his fourth symptom-free year following surgery. He is doing very well, but the emotions run deep when he and Lori return to Madison for Gary’s periodic MRI brain scans.</p><p>&quot;Dr. Baskaya and Letty are just so warm and caring, and even though we get nervous waiting for the result after an MRI, we know things will be OK,” Lori says. &quot;They truly are like angels from God.&quot;</p>",

She has had two knee replacements and recently underwent knee revision surgery with <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/john-k-wollaeger-md/7960\">Dr.John K. Wollaeger</a>. Her advice to anyone who needs a joint replacement—don’t wait. She shares her story to encourage others.</p><p>On August 2, 2019, I had knee revision surgery. This would be the 2nd surgery for my right knee. (Left knee replaced August 2015). The previous right one being January 2018. So, hearing this news from Dr. Wollaeger was challenging for me to hear, but I knew I was in the best hands ever with him, and trusted his judgment 100%, and simply knowing this eased my apprehension.</p><p> So, this was not my first rodeo so to speak, and it was nothing short of a miracle. I had a total extension a week after surgery. Left the hospital w/ no walking aids at all. Currently have and have had a flex of 127. And am currently finishing up 3 months of wonderful Physical Therapy.</p><p>This is a MUST and needed to become whole and strong and balanced again.</p><p> So, if your choices are cortisone shots or replacement, don’t go for the Band-Aids. Tackle this like your healthy life depends on it. Because with a positive attitude, courage, fortitude, and grit...you can become whole again. And live pain free.</p><p> For me there was no choice, because I have this one life, and I choose to live without regrets…Aka I should have, I wish I had, etc. Nope not for me. So get yourself over to the UW Health Ortho Clinic and see Dr. Wollaeger and his wonderful staff. Act like your life depends on it. You will never regret your decision. This will be a choice you will be forever grateful you have chosen.... I’m living proof. </p>",

Jenna Preston doesn&#39;t.</p><p>Oh, she knows she got together with her UW-Platteville friends to watch the Badgers men&#39;s basketball game on TV; the team included Ethan Happ, a friend from her 77-member graduating class from Rockridge High School in northwestern Illinois.</p><p>But sometime that night, looking for the bathroom at the house party, she opened a door and plunged down a flight of basement stairs. She doesn’t remember the ambulance, the Med Flight helicopter or her brain surgery at University Hospital. She doesn’t remember Happ visiting her in the hospital. When she finally awoke, one of the first things she does remember is gazing into the large brown eyes of a Jersey calf from her family&#39;s dairy herd.</p><p>Sometime during her two-week, medically induced coma, a large box of photo enlargements had arrived at the Neuro ICU. The photographer had been at Preston’s family farm to shoot Jenna’s graduation pictures. She made and sent the enlargements so that when – or if, really - Jenna awoke, she would see something familiar. </p><p>Jenna’s father, Brian Preston, praised the care his daughter received at UW, from Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6635</span>, who performed her surgery, to case manager Melissa Hillestad, who worked the phones for hours to convince the insurance company to approve rehabilitation care for Jenna.</p><p>&quot;And Genevieve, the nurse, was her first nurse, and the one who gave us hope that she would pull through this,&quot; Brian Preston said. “The incredible nursing staff at UW-Madison are second to none and have my complete admiration. I tell everyone how this absolute tragedy was blessed after the fact by the UW-Madison staff. They&#39;re the reason she is where she is today.&quot;</p><p>Nearly a year after that accident, Jenna has made the long road back, through two hospitals and an entire summer in a rehabilitation program, to begin her spring semester as a UW-Platteville agriculture business major.</p><p>That photo of the calf is making a trip, too, although only down the hallway of University Hospital’s 4th floor. At the end of January 2018, the hospital is opening a brand new Neuro ICU for patients like Jenna, who come in from all over the Upper Midwest through the hospital’s Level I Trauma Center.</p><p>For Pat Chesmore, the nurse who manages the unit, the photo, signed by Jenna, symbolizes the miraculous recoveries that some of their patients make.

      "story": "<p>Mere hours after a chemotherapy treatment, Dana Crumpton got in his car, drove from his home in Madison to Columbus, Ohio, and woke up to testify before an Ohio State Senate committee.</p><p>He is on the Board of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and the Ohio legislature was considering a bill to recognize an annual Hypoparathyroidism Awareness Day.</p><p>“I drove the 10 hours or so to Columbus, got in late, and had to be up by 8 a.m. to make this presentation,” Crumpton said. “I’ve never spoken in front of a Senate committee in my whole life. I was tired, but I did it. But that was how important it was for me to make sure this bill passed.”</p><p>After he returned, he mentioned his trip to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P6732</span>, MD, his medical oncologist at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15041</span>. She told him to keep her informed of his travel plans so his care team could adjust his treatment schedule. It was a good thing she did, because Crumpton is continuing to travel and to advocate on behalf of patients.</p><p>In 2014, Crumpton was diagnosed with colon cancer. A year and a half later, the cancer had recurred, this time spreading to his lungs and liver. This past January, he learned the cancer in his liver was inoperable. The outpatient palliative care team at UW Carbone joined his care team, and he is now on chemotherapy to reduce the tumors’ growth.</p><div></div><p>Crumpton is realistic about his diagnosis – “My family and I, we’re completing my bucket list right now,” he said – but he is also not letting him stop it from leaving a legacy for his family, and for the many colon cancer and hypoparathyroidism patients for whom he is still advocating. Crumpton is currently completing dignity therapy, a life review experience with Jean Ligocki, LCSW, CT, a social worker on his care team.</p><p>“Anyone who gets a cancer diagnosis begins looking at their life very differently than they had prior to the diagnosis, so dignity therapy is a way for them to explore and share with others the wisdom and the beauty of their life,” Ligocki said. “We, any trained facilitator, sit down with a patient and interview them – we talk about the impact of their life and who and what they have loved. It’s a very powerful experience.”</p><p>During the interview, the facilitator has a conversation with the patient, asking such questions as “What do you feel most proud of?” “When did you feel most alive?” or “What do you want your loved ones to remember about you?” The recorded conversation is typed up, read to the patient and edited. A final document is printed and uploaded to a USB drive for the patient.</p><p>Research on dignity therapy has found that, for example, around 70 percent of participants report it as increasing their sense of dignity and purpose. Ninety-five percent of family members believe it has been helpful to their loved one.</p><p>Crumpton says that when Jean approached him about dignity therapy, he of course said &quot;yes,&quot; because reaching and educating people is so important to him.</p><p>“I’ve had about a dozen friends who are at risk because of family history, but they’ve always afraid to get checked. They kept putting it off, mainly because of what they might find,” Crumpton said. “But because of me being so positive and strong and talking about it, they finally went and got checked. And they’ve all been clear.”</p><p>Crumpton is currently editing his document, and he is busy traveling and educating. He is attending his first Colorectal Cancer Alliance conference in Houston this fall. There, he will be able to meet many of the people with whom he has connected online. He also views the conference as a place to work with the doctors as a patient advocate, emphasizing to them that the patients and their caregivers should be viewed as part of the care team.</p><p>In between all that, he and his husband, Ron, will travel – lots of travel. Checking off items on his bucket list, they will stay at historic hotels and take a cruise with their daughter. Crumpton said that when his doctors tell him nothing more can be done for his liver, he wants to hop in an RV with Ron, see Mount Rushmore for the first time, and continue on a road trip until he cannot any longer.</p><p>Patients completing dignity therapy choose whom they want their document to address, often a spouse, or their immediate family. For Crumpton, his is directed towards his husband and daughter – and to all patients facing a cancer diagnosis.</p><p>“Each cancer affects everyone differently. But I’m going to keep fighting,” Crumpton said. “If you don’t, cancer takes over you.”</p><h3>About dignity therapy</h3><p>If you are a patient interested in completing dignity therapy, please contact Jean Ligocki, Outpatient Palliative Care Social Worker, at <a href=\"mailto:jligocki@uwhealth.org\">jligocki@uwhealth.org</a> or <a href=\"tel:6082638633\">(608) 263-8633</a>, or Cassi Shumway, Outpatient Palliative Care Nurse Coordinator, at <a href=\"mailto:cshumway@uwhealth.org\">cshumway@uwhealth.org</a> or <a href=\"tel:6082630342\">(608) 263-0342</a>.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Months after moving to Madison, Phyllis Esposito was on the lookout for a new doctor.</p><p>A Kansas City native, she was living with her husband in Olympia, Wash., when a job opportunity arose at Edgewood College. Her husband had gone to grad school in Madison, so moving to Wisconsin was a homecoming of sorts. Prior to leaving, she saw her doctor in Washington for an exam and mammogram, and everything appeared fine.</p><p>But in May, after finding that new doctor, she went in for a routine physical exam, which included another mammogram. While the physical exam didn’t turn up anything unusual, the mammogram found a large tumor in her right breast – stage IIA breast cancer.</p><p>That diagnosis led to several other tests and scans, and an MRI showed that her cancer was bilateral, meaning the disease was present in both breasts.</p><p>All of this brought Esposito to the <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/47424\">UW Carbone Cancer Center</a>, where she met surgeon <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/david-melnick-md-mph-facs/6888\">David Melnick</a>, MD, and oncologist <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/mark-e-burkard-md-phd/8244\">Mark Burkard</a>, MD, who put Esposito on a multi-faceted treatment plan. “I get to tick all the boxes,” Esposito said. “Two different rounds of chemo, surgery, radiation, possibly more chemo, and then hormone therapy.”</p><p>She can also add clinical trial participant to that list.</p><p>Burkard just happened to be the principal investigator on a study that’s looking at why some breast cancers respond to paclitaxel chemotherapy, and others do not. Paclitaxel chemo, also known as Taxol, is often used to treat early stages of breast cancer, and is frequently used in conjunction with other chemo drugs. </p><blockquote><p>The information that’s gained is immeasurable.</p></blockquote><p>Because Esposito was already set to receive this drug, and fit the study’s other criteria, Burkard asked if she’d be willing to be part of the trial.</p><p>While clinical trials often test new drugs and offer novel approaches to treatment, others refine what researchers know about existing treatments. In Esposito’s case, it was the latter, and required flipping the order of the two chemotherapy drugs she was already set to receive as part of standard treatment, to see what impact it might have on her tumors. While the impact of doing this is certainly of interest to researchers, the immediate benefit to Esposito – who still would require surgery and other treatments – was less clear.</p><p>Despite that, she was still interested in taking part in the trial. “I was intrigued by it because I wanted to understand what the difference was between the different chemo drugs and I was also curious to know, given the size of the particular tumor that I have on the right side, what would be the impact,” she said.</p><p>Deciding to participate in a clinical trial can be a difficult decision, especially when juggling all the other factors that come with a cancer diagnosis. What helped for Esposito and her husband was how Burkard approached the topic and how he extended the invitation. “When we came into Dr. Burkard’s office, he said, ‘I want to get to know you first, and then I have questions, and then we can talk about everything else,’” Esposito said. “There was just a way of easing us into it that began to build trust and build a relationship.”</p><p>As for Burkard, he credits individuals like Esposito for their willingness to contribute to research that will benefit future patients. “It is hard to think of others when facing a new diagnosis of breast cancer, but Phyllis and several other brave women generously agreed to provide one or two research biopsies after getting Taxol,” he said. “This allows us to see how their cancer uniquely reacts to the medicine. In the future, we hope to use this information to pick which patients should get Taxol and which should get something different.”</p><p>Over the subsequent three months, Esposito received the paclitaxel chemotherapy, and it does appear that the tumor in her right breast has shrunk some. She’s now moved on to a second chemotherapy drug, meaning her participation in the trial has come to an end. Ultimately, she hopes that other patients who may be in a similar situation will choose to participate in a clinical trial, even if that immediate, tangible benefit might not be clear. </p><p>“The information that’s gained is immeasurable,” she said. “While it didn’t necessarily alter what my treatment plan was, or my standard of care, it’s providing information so that if folks can figure this out and people can get treatment a little bit sooner, then that’s all the better.”</p><p><b>Do you have questions about clinical trials?

      "story": "<p>After 30 years in nursing, and a military career, Jerome Christensen thought he had seen it all. He never imagined how important all those experiences would be in his own health struggle.</p><p>As a young man, Jerome originally joined the Navy as means to pay for college. He was a Navy medic, but quickly decided he wanted to be a nurse. &quot;I saw what they were doing for patients and knew that work would be right for me,&quot; Jerome said.</p><p>After he left the Navy, he joined his mother and brother as nurses at St. Mary&#39;s Hospital, a Level 2 trauma center in Kankakee, Ill. As an emergency room nurse, Jerome said he &quot;saw more bad things there then I did in the military,&quot; but continued that work for 10 years before returning to the Navy. Jerome served as the only nurse on the USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf. After he developed an allergy to latex, Jerome left the Navy and returned to St. Mary&#39;s as a nursing supervisor.</p><p>Jerome loved his work. Life was good. He was happily married to Mary Kay and spent time keeping up his house and large property. His lengthy nursing career gave him the insight for how he should be cared for, if his health ever changed. He never guessed how much he would need that help. </p><p>In 2015, Jerome began experiencing stomach problems. Tests showed he suffered from undetermined non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. His abdomen would fill with fluid that needed to be drained, and for months, that was his routine. To ease this burden, a shunt was placed, and new medications were prescribed. As a nurse, he grasped everything he was experiencing and asked a lot of questions. He understood exactly what his doctors meant when they said, &quot;It&#39;s time that you&#39;re listed for a liver transplant.&quot;</p><p>Originally listed at a Chicago transplant program and knowing that he was low on the waitlist, Jerome did some research. &quot;It&#39;s odd to be sick enough that you need a transplant and then hear you&#39;re not sick enough to get a liver,&quot; said Jerome.</p><p>After spending some time do online research, he soon learned that wait times at UW Health are shorter than other programs, and with excellent outcomes. The program is one of just six in the nation approved to serve veterans and works in tandem with the specialists at William S. Middleton Memorial Veteran&#39;s Hospital liver transplant program. Jerome made the 4-hour drive to Madison, Wis., to meet the team and be evaluated. That&#39;s where he learned that he needed a heart bypass or he wouldn&#39;t survive a liver transplant.</p><p>After he recovered from the bypass surgery, Jerome was placed on the active liver transplant wait list. He continued to struggle with his liver issues, lost his appetite - and 70 pounds - and &quot;looked ancient,&quot; Jerome said. &quot;I got tired so easily and had absolutely no strength.&quot; Within weeks of wait listing, Jerome received his gift of life.</p><p>Even as a nurse, transplant was new to Jerome, but &quot;they explained everything very thoroughly, in a good way, that impressed me,&quot; Jerome said. </p><p>&quot;I know what it means to have good care, and everyone was amazing. When I saw that everyone was happy - from housekeeping to the doctors - I knew I was in the best place. I thought to myself, &#39;I&#39;d love to be in charge of this unit.&#39; That&#39;s how pleasant it was.&quot; </p><p>Within weeks, Jerome&#39;s appetite returned. He&#39;s back at home and enjoying the life he knew before he became ill. He&#39;s looking forward to making tables out of a hickory tree that fell down on his property. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll make some shelves, too, and a shadow box for my military awards,&quot; Jerome said.</p><p>Now married for 15 years, Mary Kay and Jerome are planning to renew their wedding vows in January. &quot;We&#39;re going to do it up right!&quot; Jerome said.</p>",

      "story": "<p>Many children who need a kidney transplant at an early age are born with a condition that causes their renal system to deteriorate. Not Rykal Wasson.</p><p>The Ettrick, Wis., boy was a happy, healthy infant - until he developed a case of pneumonia at 11 months of age that took only a few days to turn his young life upside down. Rykal had developed pneumococcal hemolytic uremic syndrome, a rare complication of pneumonia that causes the kidneys to shut down.</p><p>When doctors told his parents, Lacey Johnson and Wally Wasson, that he was in complete kidney failure and needed emergency transport to <a href=\"https://www.uwhealthkids.org/\">American Family Children&#39;s Hospital</a> in Madison, she could hardly believe it. &quot;I knew there was something wrong with my son, but I didn&#39;t imagine it was this bad,&quot; she says. </p><p>They arrived in Madison in the middle of the night and met <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/sharon-m-bartosh-md/5470\">Sharon Bartosh</a>, MD, pediatric nephrologist at UW Health, right away. Dr. Bartosh put Rykal on peritoneal dialysis - a method of cleaning the blood when the kidneys no longer work well. For two weeks at the hospital, Rykal required dialysis in the pediatric intensive care unit 24 hours a day. Once he was stable, he moved to the general transplant floor, where he stayed for another three weeks. He went home on dialysis, and a month later, his parents learned his kidneys would never regain full function and he needed a kidney transplant.</p><p>Both Lacey and Wally underwent testing to be living kidney donors, but Lacey was a better match than her fiancé. On Aug. 2, 2018, she gave the gift of life to her 19-month-old son. &quot;I would do anything for my kid,&quot; she says. &quot;It was a long process, but I would do it again in a heartbeat.&quot; </p><p>While Rykal was fortunate that his mother could be his living kidney donor, the frequent trips to Madison and unpaid time off from work before, during and after his transplant, took their toll on his family. Lacey and Wally struggled to keep up with their house payment and other bills. So, their community stepped up and organized a benefit to help the family in the spring of 2018. </p><p>After receiving his mom&#39;s kidney, Rykal blossomed. He had endured so many restrictions while on dialysis, and one by one, his doctors began to lift those restrictions as his health continued to improve. For example, while on dialysis he was only able to drink 8 ounces of water in a day. Now, he drinks about 2 liters of water each day. He loves to ride his four-wheel bike and, given the choice, would stay outside all day, every day.</p><p>&quot;With everything he has been through, he has no fear,&quot; says Lacey. &quot;He has boundless energy. I firmly believe Rykal is going to be one of the strongest children anyone has ever met.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>On March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic, the course of Jamila Hudson’s life changed forever.</p><p>Not because of any impact from the novel Coronavirus, but because of the living kidney transplant she received that day—the last transplant surgery performed at University Hospital before elective surgeries were temporarily postponed until late May.</p><p>“Given what we knew about COVID at the time, I obviously needed to weigh the risks of having a major surgery while being significantly immunocompromised with the long term-risk of waiting for another donor kidney to become available,” said Hudson, a 38-year-old Pewaukee resident and two-time kidney transplant recipient. “After speaking with my transplant coordinator and hearing about the precautions being implemented at the hospital, I felt very comfortable with moving ahead with my surgery when I did and I’m incredibly grateful that my quality of life has improved significantly as a result.”</p><p>Hudson had been on the transplant waiting list for a deceased donor kidney to become available, but she was able to receive a “chain-end” living donor match through the National Kidney Registry. Chain-end matches occur when the final kidney from a living donor kidney chain goes to somebody from the deceased donor waiting list.</p><p>In addition to encouraging patients to schedule their surgeries and other procedures, Hudson is also interested raising awareness about the need for more donors among people of color. While transplants can be successful regardless of the race or ethnicity of the donor and recipient, the chance of longer-term survival may be greater if the donor and recipient are closely matched in terms of their shared genetic background. Given the disparities in kidney failure (African Americans/Blacks represent 13.2% of the overall U.S. population and more than 35% of all patients in the U.S. receiving dialysis for kidney failure), there is great need for more living and registered organ and tissue donors.</p>",

After college, she worked for several years in the Madison area as a legal assistant and as an intern at the Center for Railroad Photography &amp; Art. She is now pursuing her Master of Public Health degree at Boston University School of Public Health.</p><p>“I’ve always loved going to school and I knew I wanted to go back to school for something,” said Aviva, now 25. &quot;Having a transplant was a big factor in my choice to go into public health. I chose it because the opportunities for a career are so varied.&quot; </p><p>Aviva has been fortunate to have no major health problems since her transplant. Because of that, she has felt more comfortable traveling extensively — since her transplant, she has visited 16 countries, including Croatia and Montenegro.</p><p>“Immunosuppression can be a little challenging in some areas,” she said, “but I enjoy the challenge of making that work. If I’m traveling in a different country, I’m very careful with what I eat and drink, and what environment I’m sleeping in.”</p><p>Of course, the transition from having Aviva close by to having her hundreds of miles away has been challenging for Sam and her mom, Julie Plotkin.</p><p>“Kids are so central to your existence, and then one day they walk out the door and move somewhere,” said Sam, who is a professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “But I am grateful I still have her to talk to and give a hug and kiss to whenever I see her.”</p><p>While the recovery was his donation took some time, Sam has not experienced any lasting effects at all — other than the scar. In fact, he went on an intense hiking trip with Aviva in Yellowstone National Park last summer.</p><p>“I worried that I would be able to keep up with her,” he said, “but during the trip, she turned to me and said, &#39;Dad, you have more stamina than my friends.&#39; So I guess I’m still doing OK.&quot;</p>",

Dean regularly saw his UW Health hepatologist <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7357</span> and came to University Hospital as often as twice each month to have fluid drained from his abdomen.</p><p>In August 2018, Dean finally hit the point of no return. He developed an infection in his abdomen, and his transplant coordinator told his wife, Tammy, to bring him to the Reedsburg emergency room right away. Over the next eight hours, his health rapidly deteriorated. Doctors in Reedsburg determined he needed to be admitted to University Hospital right away and transported him there via ambulance. “He was so sick,” says Tammy. “I was concerned he was not going to make it. I was just relieved that other people were caring for him, and that he was in the right place to receive treatment.”</p><p>By that point, he was sick enough to rise to the top of the transplant list—but he couldn’t be transplanted until his infection was successfully treated. Fortunately, his doctors were able to get his infection under control and reestablish him on the transplant list within a couple of days, and, amazingly, a liver became available right away. The next day, his family came to the hospital for the surgery, but a transplant surgeon told him the liver was not good enough. “My wife told me and my children, ‘Don’t worry. I will get your father a liver for your anniversary,’” says Dean.</p><p>Their anniversary was two days later—and sure enough, Dean received a call that day with another liver.

Seven days later, he developed complications, and he required a procedure to fix his bile duct. After the procedure and a second surgery, his health dramatically improved, and three months after the transplant, he returned to his job as a construction field superintendent.</p><p>“I’m doing extremely well,” he says, “I feel like a new person and have energy I haven’t felt for years.

The only cure was a liver transplant, but Brayden was too small, and his doctors wanted him to grow bigger and stronger before undergoing surgery.</p><p>In the meantime, Brayden became sicker and sicker.

But, as she grew older, it became clear to her parents that she also suffered from another complication of the disease — hypoglycemia unawareness, a rare complication in which her body failed to warn her that her blood sugar levels were becoming low. Hypoglycemia unawareness can result in a seizure, loss of consciousness or brain damage. </p><p>While Bree was able to manage her disease by regularly monitoring her blood sugar levels and receiving insulin injections, her hypoglycemia unawareness made blood glucose control more difficult and put her at greater risk for severe complications.</p><p>“We tested frequently,” says Shari. “She always had to check her blood sugar before her team left for a game. We tried to be as prepared as possible, sending a bag of Skittles with her whenever she was doing something active so she could avoid hypoglycemia.”</p><p>On December 7, 2017, Bree became the first pediatric patient to undergo an isolated pancreas transplant at American Family Children’s Hospital in Madison. The intention was to eliminate her diabetes so she would no longer have to worry about whether her blood sugar was too low. And it worked. She spent just six days in the hospital, then went back to school after her holiday break. Today, she is a healthy, active teenager who doesn’t have to be concerned about life-threatening instances of hypoglycemia.</p><p>“When you’re the parent of a child with Type 1 diabetes, you’re always worrying, always on edge,” says Shari. “Now, I feel like I can sleep at night and not worry about her.”</p>",

But they told me I needed the LVAD if I wanted to be there for my baby’s birth.&quot;</p><p>He received the LVAD on Jan. 9, 2019, and finally went home in February. Doctors told him he needed a heart transplant, but they would wait until he had healed from the surgery before activating him on the waitlist. Once he was activated, he would probably wait about two years for a heart, he was told.</p><p>In the meantime, Chuck was undergoing cardiac rehabilitation close to home when a nurse there told him about the UW Health Transplant Program in Madison, Wis. She suggested he pursue dual listing — having his name on the waitlist for a heart at two hospitals. He checked out the UW Health website and decided to give the staff a call.</p><p>By July, he was meeting with <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9500</span>, MD, medical director of UW Health’s Heart Failure and Transplant Program. “He explained to me what my heart was and wasn’t doing,” Chuck said. “No one had ever spent that kind of time explaining it to me before.”</p><p>In August, Chuck spent three days in Madison meeting the entire transplant team. Before he could be listed at UW Health, he needed to undergo numerous tests, which he arranged with his primary care physician.</p><p>By the beginning of September, he was officially on the wait list for a new heart in Madison. A mere three days later, he received a call that a heart had become available. “I was completely shocked,” he says. “We thought it was going to take a lot longer than that. Suddenly, they were asking me if I could be in Madison in 3 hours, and I said, &#39;Absolutely.&#39; &quot;</p><p>Chuck and Alicia left their 2- and 3-year-olds with her parents, and they brought their newborn along with them. On Sept. 8, he received the gift of life with a new heart, and by the beginning of October, he was back in Huntley, healing from the surgery.</p><p>“The entire time I was in Madison, the staff was very positive and upbeat,” he says. “You could never tell if someone was having a bad day.”</p><p>Chuck returned to light duty in November 2019, and to his surprise, he was back to full duty at the beginning of December — a goal for which he hadn’t even dared to hope.</p><p>“I don’t want to boast, but I haven’t felt this good in years,” he says. “I have a lot of things I want to accomplish. I’ve been given a second chance, and I’m so grateful.”</p>",

Julie also suffered from ascites, a condition that caused fluid to build up in her stomach, making her look like she was pregnant. &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t walk, I couldn&#39;t sit,&quot; Julie said. &quot;My life was very uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p>In March 2018, Julie&#39;s gastroenterologist referred her to <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P9161</span>, MD, a hepatologist at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 15138</span>. The gastroenterologist felt she needed more help than he would be able to give her, and he knew UW Health has a stellar reputation for helping patients who need a liver transplant.</p><p>Rather than traveling to Madison, Julie saw Dr. Rice at UW Health&#39;s Transplant Clinic in Waukesha - just a 10-minute drive from her house. &quot;It was really nice because I didn&#39;t have to drive all the way to Madison,&quot; she said.</p><p>Given the severity of her liver disease, Dr. Rice knew a transplant was her only option. She went on the waitlist in July and got her liver in September.</p><p>&quot;I was jumping for joy, and then I was crying when I found out they had a new liver for me,&quot; Julie said. That gift of life, and short waiting time, turned out to be even more critical because a small amount of <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: 13240</span> - a common complication of cirrhosis and Hepatitis B - was discovered in Julie&#39;s sick liver after it was removed.</p><p>Since her transplant, Julie has improved remarkably. She can undergo all her bloodwork locally, and she has seen Dr. Rice in both Waukesha and Madison. &quot;The care at UW Health is unbelievable,&quot; she said. &quot;Everyone I have encountered has been phenomenal.&quot;</p>",

      "story": "<p>For about 20 years, Lorry Adkins lived in constant fear that she would lose consciousness due to low blood sugar from her type 1 diabetes. Two of the times this happened, the Knoxville, Iowa woman nearly died.</p><p>Then, a co-worker showed her a mailing she received from the UW Health Transplant Program in Madison. The mailing explained how patients with diabetes were finding new hope through a pancreas transplant. Lorry booked an appointment in Madison and it changed her life.</p><p>Diagnosed with diabetes at age 9, Lorry stayed relatively healthy as a child and young adult. Then, in her 30s, she started experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness, a rare complication in which her body failed to generate the characteristic symptoms of hypoglycemia that would warn her of low blood sugar levels. At the time, she was a single mom of two young children. She remembers one incident when her 8-year-old son came into her room at night to cuddle, noticed she wasn&#39;t responsive, and gave her a shot of glucagon - a hormone that can treat severe low blood sugar.</p><p>Her first near-death experience was when she suffered hypoglycemia while driving and drove into a ditch. A passing motorist called 911 and she received treatment at the local emergency room. Another time, she was working outside her house in November and passed out in her front yard. Her husband, who works as a truck driver and was out of town, panicked when he couldn&#39;t reach her and called a neighbor to check on her. When the neighbor found Lorry, her body temperature was only 82 degrees. She stayed overnight at the hospital and was able to recover. &quot;It was really scary, not knowing when my blood sugar was going to dip too low,&quot; she says.</p><p>Lorry works as a nurse in a clinic and decided to talk to a physician assistant (PA) there about whether she might be a candidate for a pancreas transplant. The PA showed her the information from UW Health, and Lorry called Nancy Radke, RN, MSN, transplant coordinator. It took about a year for Lorry to become active on the wait list for a new pancreas because she learned she had heart problems and needed stents installed. But once she was finally active, she received a call just a day later that an organ had become available.</p><p>Lorry received her gift of life in August 2018 at University Hospital in Madison. Since then, Nancy, who has been her coordinator throughout the entire process, has become a close ally. She checks in on Lorry frequently and has been a welcome source of information. &quot;If I ever have any questions, she&#39;s very easy to reach,&quot; says Lorry.</p><p>Gone are the days when Lorry had to carry around all her emergency sugar supplies. &quot;It&#39;s unbelievable,&quot; she says. &quot;It was such a miracle to have this transplant. I&#39;m ecstatic that I don&#39;t have to worry about low blood sugar anymore. Now I can do whatever I want to do, whenever I want to do it.&quot;</p>",

Splitting his time between his childhood home in Wisner, Neb., and the dude ranch near Eagle, Colo., Harlan likes to push himself as much as possible.\r \r</p><p>\rTen years ago, he wondered if his active life was coming to an end. In 2010, he started developing severe problems with his upper respiratory tract, first coming down with the flu and then pneumonia. Within a matter of weeks, his lungs were functioning at less than 20 percent capacity and it was clear to his doctors that he needed a lung transplant quickly or he would die. Harlan served in the Vietnam War as a long-range reconnaissance sniper for the U.S. Marine Corps, so he receives health care services from the Veterans Administration. His caretaker drove him from Nebraska to the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, one of just two lung transplant programs in the United States approved for veterans. Harlan was placed on the wait list for a new set of lungs the same day he arrived in Madison, and just 3 hours later, he learned he was about to receive the gift of life. &quot;I was unloading my vehicle in the parking lot when I got the call,&quot; he says. &quot;I probably hold the record for the least amount of time on the wait list.&quot;\r \r\n\r\nWhen Harlan served in the Marine Corps, he wanted to be on the reconnaissance team because it was comprised of the top 3 percent of all recruits. &quot;I wanted to be in a select, very smart, very athletic group,&quot; he says. A carpenter by trade, he continues to challenge himself following his transplant. Two years ago, he spent time roaming around Alaska - camping, boating, hiking and panning for gold. He works out regularly and keeps busy at the ranch and participating in other outdoor activities. His transplant has enabled him to pursue a limitless number of hobbies and interests that never would have been possible without a lung transplant.\r</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ve had 10 years with this gift of a new set of lungs,&quot; says Harlan, &quot;and I plan on using it to the fullest and making it last as long as possible.

      "story": "<p>Tashiana (Tash) Smith was just 10 years old when she learned she had Type 1 diabetes.</p><p>She spent days, sometimes weeks, in the hospital for ketoacidosis - when dangerous level of blood sugar and acids accumulate in the body. Tash learned she was a &quot;brittle diabetic,&quot; meaning her blood sugar levels would go from one extreme to the next. She was constantly checking her blood sugars and injecting insulin four or five times a day.</p><p>It was not the way she wanted to go through life.</p><p>Tash continued to struggle with her diabetes through high school and college. &quot;I used to feel so out of place because every few hours I would have to worry about checking my blood sugar and take insulin,&quot; Tashiana said. &quot;I felt as though I would never get to live my life the way I really wanted to live it.&quot;</p><p>In her early 20s, Tash began using an insulin pump, but the same problems returned, and she went back to using needles and syringes. Then Tash had her first seizure. Alone and scared, she was fortunate it woke her from her sleep.</p><p>Over the next few years, the seizures continued, and she started losing her appetite, lost weight and was getting sick to the point where often, an ambulance had to be called. She was diagnosed with gastroparesis and had to closely monitor her diet because so many foods were triggers.</p><p>&quot;I lost count of how many times I was in and out of the hospital for gastroparesis,&quot; Tash said. &quot;I asked God to take this away because I hated the way it made me feel.&quot;</p><p>During this time, Tash was diagnosed with stage three kidney disease, and was told she would soon need dialysis. That day arrived less than a year later.</p><p>“I cried during my entire treatment,” Tash said. “All I could think was that I was only in my 20s. I went to dialysis three times a week and would pray each and every day that I would not have to live like that for the rest of my life.&quot;</p><p>It was a family friend who told Tash about her husband, who had just received a kidney and pancreas transplant and no longer had diabetes or kidney disease. He had been on the wait list in Chicago but said that wait times were shorter at UW Health.</p><p>&quot;I thought to myself, &#39;Wow! I’ve had diabetes for as long as I can remember,&#39; &quot; Tash said. &quot;I couldn’t imagine what it would feel like if I didn’t have it anymore.&quot;</p><p>Tash researched the transplant process and scheduled her consultation. She met with the UW Health team and was listed in February 2020. Things moved quickly and Tash received an organ offer in March, but the pancreas wasn’t viable. &quot;I was devastated,&quot; Tash said, &quot;but I did not lose faith, because I knew if I received one call, I would receive another.&quot;</p><p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Organ donations slowed and hospital operations focused on safety and urgent needs. Tash’s next organ offer came in May, less than a week before her 29th birthday, but that pancreas wasn’t good enough for transplant. &quot;I knew delayed was not denied,&quot; Tash said. A few more offers came in, but they weren’t acceptable for transplant. On a trip back home from the hospital, Tash’s phone rang with another offer. Tash and her mom, Benetta, turned the car around and within hours she received her gift of life.</p><p>Tash’s gratitude begins with the organ donor who changed her life. “I encourage everyone, especially people of minority communities, to register as a donor. The wait list is full of people from minority communities, and more of them will get better matches and live longer if their organ is from someone with similar genetics.&quot;</p><p>The vast majority of Americans support donation as an opportunity to give life and health to others. Unfortunately, many people overlook the important step of <a href=\"http://www.organdonor.gov/\">registering as a donor</a>, which saves their loved ones from having to make the decision at a time of shock and grief.</p><p>Her deep gratitude includes the support her mom provides - &quot;Mom has been very instrumental throughout this entire blessing,&quot; said Tash - and includes the staff at UW Health, who were &quot;beyond amazing and patient. I would recommend this hospital to anyone in a heartbeat.&quot;</p><p>Tash is thrilled she has this chance to start a new kind of life. &quot;I feel wonderful and truly blessed,&quot; Tash said. &quot;No more insulin, no more diabetes, no more dialysis. I can live a normal, regular life. Finally.&quot;</p>",

An episode of E. coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) resulted in kidney failure and brain damage.</p><p>&quot;Lindsay is a miracle,&quot; said her mom, Rhonda. &quot;We were told she would never walk or talk again, but her recovery has been remarkable.&quot;</p><p>Lindsay got sick in July 1990, and she spent July through September in the hospital. When she came home, she had a feeding tube because she was unable to eat by mouth, and could not walk or talk. She also experienced temporary blindness.</p><p>&quot;But when she got home, things started coming together,&quot; Rhonda said. &quot;By Thanksgiving, she was learning to walk again.&quot;</p><p>Though she understands a great deal, she speaks only in one- or two-word sentences and uses some sign language to communicate. But Lindsay has never let the obstacles she faces deter her optimism and joy.</p><p>&quot;She is the happiest person in the world,&quot; Rhonda said. &quot;Wherever she goes, whoever she meets, people just fall in love with her.&quot;</p><h3>Kidney transplant needed</h3><p>As Lindsay grew, her kidney function worsened. She became very thin, tired and nauseated. She had her kidney transplant, with her mother serving as her donor, at age 9.</p><p>&quot;The transplant went so well,&quot; Rhonda said. &quot;She felt so much better after her transplant.

Nothing got by them,&quot; she said.</p><p>Since graduation, Lindsay has attended an in-home day care center, though she sees it more as her job.</p><p>&quot;She loves going there,&quot; Rhonda said. &quot;She helps out like an assistant would, and has even taught some of the children sign language.&quot;</p><p>Like many young women, Lindsay enjoys shopping, especially for shoes. She loves country music, boating, fishing and swimming. She&#39;s earned medals and ribbons as a gymnast in the Special Olympics, and has made many friends through her gymnastics program.</p><h3>Miss RemarkAble Pageant</h3><p>When Rhonda heard about the Miss RemarkAble Pageant happening in their hometown of Onalaska, Wis., she knew Lindsay would love it.</p><p>Lindsay applied and was accepted as one of nine contestants who would experience a one-of-a-kind opportunity to build life skills, confidence and share her abilities and accomplishments.</p><p>Lindsay practiced her introduction and prepared for the question-and-answer session, as well as walking across the stage and waving. She loved the wardrobe changes, getting her hair and make-up done and meeting Miss Wisconsin and Miss Onalaska.</p><p>Lindsay was crowned &quot;Miss Incredible,&quot; in recognition of everything she has endured, and she proudly accepted her crown, sash and flowers.</p><p>Though Lindsay&#39;s journey hasn&#39;t been easy, her family never lost hope.</p><p>&quot;When she was little and so sick, we really just took one day at a time,&quot; Rhonda said. &quot;We never looked too far into the future, but did everything we could to support her and to keep a positive attitude.&quot;</p><p>Today, Lindsay and her family are happily looking into the future as they plan a baby shower for Lindsay&#39;s brother and wife.

His MELD score — the system used to determine the level of illness and need — meant it would be some time before he could be placed on the wait list for a deceased donor liver.</p><p>In the meantime, he would continue to become sicker. Receiving a portion of liver from a living donor meant he could receive a transplant much sooner. Kevin has a total of six siblings, each of whom wanted to be his donor, but after months of testing, Patti was the only match for her brother.</p><p>“Kevin taught me patience — not only through all the testing, but also through my life today,” she said. “All I kept thinking was that it was not about the ‘award’ — reaching a goal. It was about the ‘reward’ that impacts your life when you give to somebody else.”</p><p>The surgery was on Aug. 21, 2017, at University Hospital in Madison, Wis. Her transplant team helped her through her recovery, which includes therapy to help her bounce back and prepare to return to her normal lifestyle. When she returned home, her son was there to care for her. He lives in New York City, but worked from Patti’s home for three weeks to be with her. Patti also had several friends take turns helping her during her recovery.</p><p>“You don’t know how many friends you have until you go through something like this,” she said.</p><p>From the beginning of her extensive pre-donation testing, Patti wrote about her experience on Facebook, posting a picture of her and Kevin each month. Some people in her life, in fact, joined Facebook just so they could follow her story. “It encouraged people to talk about it more,” she said.</p><p>After the surgery, Kevin felt so much better after being ill for five years, says Patti. Instead of being jaundiced, he now had color in his face, and his grandchildren came up to Patti and thanked her for giving their grandpa the gift of life. “I didn’t do it for the thanks and praise,” she said. “I did it to give my brother hope and life.&quot;</p>",

During the kidney donor application process, Mary helped Marie with her questions. During one discussion, Marie asked Mary if she knew anyone who needed a kidney, and in fact, Mary did. Sara, the sister of a co-worker, was suffering from polycystic kidney disease and needed a transplant. Marie decided to direct her donation to Sara, but wasn&#39;t a match so she and Sara became part of an eight-person kidney exchange in which Marie&#39;s kidney went to a man named Paul, from Michigan, and Sara received a kidney from another donor.\r\n\r\r\nSince giving the gift of life in July 2018, Marie has been in contact with Paul, who is back to bowling, walking and living a normal life. &quot;I&#39;ve been blessed with good health,&quot; says Marie, &quot;and there are not that many ways to pay it back.

It often results in more happy stories like Jackson’s.&quot;</p><p>With more than 100,000 people in the U.S. waiting for a kidney transplant, living donors are in high demand.

Yet for the past 10 years, she has been a regular blood donor, and in April 2018 she became an altruistic kidney donor. Her explanation — at least for donating blood — is that she wanted to be a good role model for the high school students she teaches.</p><p>As for the kidney donation, that came about because of a newspaper article she read about a local Hmong woman who needed a kidney transplant. The woman was having trouble finding a living kidney donor among her loved ones because Hmong people believe they will need their organs in their next life.</p><p>&quot;I taught English as a second language to adults for five years at a technical college,” Colleen said. “I have a soft spot in my heart for the Hmong community.&quot;</p><p>Colleen reached out to the woman through LinkedIn and asked what she needed to do to be tested for living kidney donation. She traveled to University Hospital in Madison and underwent the necessary testing, eventually learning she was not a match for the woman.</p><p>They decided to participate in a paired exchange, in which Colleen donates a kidney on the woman’s behalf, and the woman receives a kidney from another living donor. Colleen donated her kidney on April 19, 2018, and later learned it went to a recipient on the East or West Coast. “It was the most amazing, most important thing I’ve ever done in my life — aside from bringing two children into the world,” Colleen said.</p><p>The Hmong woman underwent her own surgery in June — it turned out that one of her acquaintances was a match, so she received that person’s kidney. But Colleen doesn’t regret giving her kidney to a stranger for a second.</p><p>&quot;Just a couple weeks of discomfort is totally worth giving someone a whole new life,” she said. “I feel like I was more blessed with this whole experience than the recipient. Now that I’ve learned so much about it, I want to tell everybody to consider it.&quot;</p>",

She was able to give the gift of life to six people and the gift of sight to two others.</p><p>“Emily had signed up to be a donor when she was 16,” Dawn said. “She took the pressure off us, so we didn’t have to make the decision for her.

My already thin husband was wasting away before my very eyes. And, like most husbands, was in complete denial and not following doctor’s orders well. He continued to say, &quot;I feel fine.&quot; The day the hospital called with lab results and told me I should immediately take him to the emergency room, he went for a three-mile run. I’m sure you can understand the frustration. I awoke each morning listening for his breathing, fearing that I would find him cold and unresponsive. Not cool. </p><p><b>Selfish Reason No. 2: I was hungry</b>\nScott fought having the dreaded dialysis treatments for as long as he possibly could. Who can blame him? After finally getting an emergency port put in his chest with a direct line to his heart, he had to admit that maybe something wasn’t quite right. We met with the dietitian, and promptly gave up eating foods like potatoes, tomatoes and for the love of God, cheese. And, because I am lazy, I ate the same things he ate. After all, I wasn’t about to cook two dinners!</p><p><b>Selfish Reason No. 3: I&#39;m impatient</b>\nScott’s sister was a perfect match. UW Health welcomed her with open arms, walked her through the process and treated her like the rock star that any willing donor is. Unfortunately, she found that she was beginning her own kidney journey. Then, Scott’s daughter was a match. She didn’t pass the evaluation either. I thought, &quot;Enough already!&quot; I put my arms around Scott and informed him that I had made my appointment to be tested. Being the stubborn man he is, he began to argue with me. I simply put my finger over his mouth and said &quot;I’m telling you, not asking you. Let’s get this done already.&quot; Sometimes, if you want things done, you have to do them yourself! After all, who doesn’t want the rock star treatment, right?</p><p><b>Selfish Reason No. 4: I had a lot to learn</b>\nThrough this entire process I felt the overwhelming need for control and struggled to differentiate between what I could and could not control. I wanted to control Scott’s response to his doctors. I controlled his diet. I made back-up plans for everything. I even controlled my end - finding an organ. I call it the ultimate BOGO event: Bring an Organ, Get an Organ. The lesson I learned? I control nothing; God does. He did it all. I learned to shut up and get out of his way. He put UW Health in our lives. Everyone from the &quot;tour guide&quot; to the social worker to the surgeons - they were all put in our lives at precisely the moment we needed them. Every single individual we encountered at UW Health was a Godsend.</p><p><b>Selfish Reason No. 5: Getting to enjoy my empty nest with my best friend\n</b>There’s nothing like a life and death experience to put things in perspective. Every day is a gift, and Scott and I don’t sweat the small stuff anymore. We are the living example of all the clichés, and couldn’t be happier. And, I had an added bonus: Because we did the paired exchange program - in 28 days flat, I might add - I got to save a stranger’s life too. Apparently, she took my kidney to the Indy 500.</p><p>I highly recommend being selfish. Save a life for all your own reasons!</p>",

He was in his prime, but he chose to take a break and give the gift of life.</p><p>Casey&#39;s reasoning is simple: &quot;She needed a liver, and I had one.&quot;</p><p>When he was growing up in Mayville, Wis., Casey played basketball throughout high school and became friends with his team&#39;s assistant coach, Matt. After Casey finished his undergraduate degree at University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, he asked Matt - who was now head coach at the high school - if he needed an assistant. Matt readily accepted, and Casey became even closer with Matt&#39;s entire family.</p><p>Casey first met Matt&#39;s wife&#39;s sister at a benefit the family organized for her in June 2018. She needed a liver transplant, and he had followed with interest on social media as her family asked others if they would consider being tested as potential donors. He asked the family if they wanted him to be tested, but they declined, since he was starting graduate school at Colorado State University that fall. However, after a potential deceased donor didn&#39;t work out for the sister, Casey decided to be tested at University Hospital in Madison, over his Thanksgiving break. &quot;The next thing I knew, I was the guy who had a matching liver,&quot; he says.</p><p>He planned the surgery to take place over his holiday break from school. While the procedure was delayed a few weeks because of the recipient&#39;s health, he ultimately donated his liver on January 11, 2019.</p><p>After leaving the hospital, Casey stayed with his parents for about a week to recover and then drove with his dad back to Colorado. His first day back to classes was Jan. 29, and while he became tired easily, he was able to ease back into his prior life. Every week, he gained more strength, and by late spring, he was pushing himself harder than ever during workouts at the gym. His liver has now regenerated, and he has unceasing motivation to make the most of every moment.</p><p>Casey has also become even closer with his recipient&#39;s whole family. &quot;These people mean a lot to me,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&#39;t know her well, but I couldn&#39;t live with myself knowing there was something I could do to help her. It was an opportunity to do some good.&quot;</p>",
