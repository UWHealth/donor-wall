        <p>Brian Forrest had been thinking a lot about his 62-year-old cousin Richard Gillette, who was suffering from end-stage liver disease.</p><p>&quot;Richard is one of five brothers who I had always looked up to when I was a kid,&quot; said Brian, 48. &quot;When they were young, all five of them came up from Illinois during the summer to help out on my dad&#39;s farm in Stratford,&quot; — a village of 1,600 in northern Wisconsin, about 30 miles west of Wausau.</p><p>Two of the five brothers died in their 50s - and Brian didn&#39;t want to see a third Gillette brother die before his time.</p><p>As sick as Richard was in the spring of 2019, he was unlikely to receive a new liver from a deceased donor in time to save his life. Too many patients were ahead of him on the transplant list - and most of them were even sicker. </p><h3>Brian makes an important call</h3><p>Richard&#39;s brother, Garry, told Brian about a friend of his who got screened to become a living liver donor. (A living donor undergoes surgery in which part, not all, of the liver is removed. Within weeks, the liver grows back in size.)</p><p>&quot;Talking with Garry made me think about becoming a living liver donor for Richard,&quot; said Brian. &quot;At first, I assumed it was unlikely that my liver would be a match for Richard. Still, I was curious enough to look into it.&quot;</p><p>Knowing that Richard was being cared for by the UW Health Transplant Team in Madison, Brian spoke with Transplant Coordinator Beth Spaith the next morning.</p><p>&quot;I knew my blood type matched Richard&#39;s, so Beth explained everything I would have to go through just to determine if I could be a donor,&quot; Brian said. &quot;It was a little daunting.&quot;</p><p>To learn if he would qualify as Richard&#39;s liver donor, Brian would have to undergo three days of extensive screening in Madison. The outcome was out of his hands, but Brian found some comfort in that.</p><p>&quot;My wife, Elaine, and I kept saying that God was driving the car and we were just riding in the back seat waiting to see where it would go,&quot; Brian said.</p><p>Also available to Brian — and to anyone considering becoming a living donor — are UW Health social workers, who go over every facet of the process and stay engaged with living donors throughout their journey.</p><p>&quot;While there is no medical benefit to becoming a living donor — and there clearly are risks — the emotional payoff of supporting a loved one or friend this way can be incredibly high,&quot; said UW Health Transplant social worker Paul Smith. </p><h3>Total support from family</h3><p>Brian made a point of involving his entire family as he weighed the pluses and minuses of donating part of his liver. If he was a match, Brian would undergo a complex surgery followed by six to 12 weeks of recuperation that would greatly impact Elaine, their five children, and the employees of his family-run dairy farm. He would not move forward without everyone&#39;s buy-in, which he received in full.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people would have to pick up the slack for me. It took a village, and we were very lucky to have a village,&quot; Brian said. Following the screening process, Brian passed every test and the transplant surgery was scheduled.</p><p>With three surgeons required, along with two comprehensive medical staffs — one for the donor and one for the recipient — scheduling a transplant surgery can take up to a few months to coordinate. Fortunately, everything fell into place for a July 1, 2019, surgery, a mere six weeks after Brian first thought about becoming a living donor. </p><h3>Would &#39;do it again in a heartbeat&#39;</h3><p>Everything went well and today, Brian is fully recovered. Richard is back home in Rockford, Ill., with a new lease on life, thanks to his generous cousin.</p><p>&quot;I would do it again in a heartbeat,&quot; Brian said. &quot;For someone considering it, this is not something to take lightly. The first week after surgery was kind of tough, but by Week 5, I was just about back to normal. It&#39;s also amazing how quickly both my liver and Richard&#39;s grew back in just a few weeks. Most of all, this whole experience brought our family even closer. It&#39;s hard to put a price on that.&quot;</p>
