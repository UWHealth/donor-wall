        <p>Claudia McCormick hopes to someday be the world&#39;s longest living pancreatic cancer survivor. </p><p>She&#39;s got the battle scars to prove it. Two rounds of abdominal surgery left her with an incision she proudly describes as &quot;a map of Route 66.”</p><p>The Beloit woman also wants to use her hard-won wisdom to inspire others faced with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.</p><p>&quot;I want to help other people and let them know to get a second opinion,&quot; she says. &quot;I would be dead right now if I hadn&#39;t followed my instinct.”</p><p>Dr. <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: P7871</span>, her surgeon at the <span>type: entry-hyperlink id: L228</span>, says that McCormick&#39;s story inspires hope.</p><p>&quot;Claudia&#39;s story is one that all of us want to be able to tell more — she is an amazing woman with resilience and fortitude, who agreed to all of our recommended aggressive treatments for pancreas cancer, and because of this, she has beaten the odds,&quot; says Weber. &quot;She has an incredible multidisciplinary team of doctors helping her through this, but the victory is all hers.”</p><p>Both McCormick and Weber want to increase the odds of surviving pancreatic cancer, so they are supporting the Aug. 12 &quot;Roll and Stroll,” to support pancreatic-cancer research at UW Carbone Cancer Center. The event includes 50- and 10-kilometer bike rides, a two-mile walk, as well as music and family fun at Capital Brewery in Middleton.</p><p>McCormick&#39;s journey began in the fall of 2016, when she noticed some vague early symptoms. She felt tired; her skin was itchy and slightly yellow. Her doctor wasn&#39;t sure what was wrong; that&#39;s when McCormick&#39;s survival instinct kicked in the first time.</p><p>&quot;I asked her to check my liver enzymes and I didn&#39;t even know what liver enzymes were, she says. They came back high. A follow-up ultrasound and biopsy revealed a tumor about one and a half inches big in the head of her pancreas. The diagnosis was stage 1B adenoma carcinoma.</p><p>After three months of FOLFIRINOX, a combination of five chemotherapy drugs, in March 2017, a surgeon at a community hospital attempted to do a Whipple procedure to remove the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, bile duct, and parts of the stomach and small intestine.</p><p>But when the surgeon opened her up, he decided he couldn&#39;t safely operate.
While McCormick was still unconscious, the surgeon gathered her family. McCormick heard the verdict herself, later.</p><p>&quot;He said there was nothing he or anyone could do and that I had months to live,&quot; she says. &quot;He basically wrote me off.”</p><p>McCormick, a mother of two grown sons and a grandmother of one, began putting her affairs in order. She got very depressed. But then she got mad.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s not God, and not going to tell me when it&#39;s time to go,&quot; she says.</p><p>Family and friends rallied around her. Her partner, Al, who had lost a wife to colon cancer, became her &quot;best angel,&quot; cooking and caring for her. Her sisters and brother-in-law chipped in with support from afar, and lots of Internet research on her disease.</p><p>&quot;I wanted to show them that their support was really meaningful,&quot; she says. &quot;Knowing how much they were doing for me, I couldn&#39;t just give up and die.”</p><p>She asked her medical oncologist to look into clinical trials, and she began another round of oral chemotherapy along with external beam radiation.</p><p>Her younger sister found supplements that she believes helped her body heal, including high dose CBD oil, Frankincense oil, turkey tail mushroom and a Chinese remedy called &quot;bitter melon,” among others.</p><p>Finally, in late August 2017, she came to the UW Carbone Cancer Center, where Weber met with her to discuss her case. McCormick was impressed.</p><p>&quot;She has this aura about her that is really serene, and these beautiful long fingers,&quot; McCormick recalled. Weber was willing to attempt another Whipple procedure, although she told McCormick her odds of being able to complete the operation were only about 50-50.</p><p>So when McCormick woke up after surgery in November 2017, her first question was: &quot;Did it happen?”</p><p>&quot;When I heard yes, I started crying,&quot; McCormick remembers.</p><p>The biopsy showed that the tumor had shrunk and had been completely removed. Since then, two scans have shown her clear of cancer. Her CA 19-9 number, which measures antigens in the blood released by tumor cells, fell from 535 at diagnosis to 35 after treatment to 13, well in the normal range, at her last check-up.</p><p>&quot;Now I have a second chance at life, and I want to get out there and help other people,&quot; she says. &quot;I tell them: You have to fight. You also need a support system. I couldn&#39;t do it alone and no one else can, either.”</p><p>She recommends the information and support available at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (<a href="https://www.pancan.org/">PanCAN</a>). Her brother-in-law found the site, and through it, she found Weber.</p><p>McCormick is getting involved in advocacy for more funding for pancreas cancer research and volunteers with UW&#39;s <a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/uw-carbone-cancer-center/pancreatic-cancer/pancreas-cancer-task-force/38121">Pancreas Cancer Task Force</a> – made up of patients, community leaders, family members, and caretakers dedicated to funding pancreas cancer research at UW&#39;s Carbone Cancer Center.</p><p>Years ago, during her corporate career, she was inspired by motivational speaker Tony Robbins, and wanted to use that passion to help others.</p><p>&quot;Since I have a second chance at life, I now have that chance to help others overcome the odds and beat this disease,&quot; she says. &quot;If I&#39;m not helping someone every day, then I&#39;m not doing enough. This, I feel absolute passionate about. I can&#39;t waste a day!”</p>
